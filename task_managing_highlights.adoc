Cloud Data Sense provides many ways for you to manage your private data. Some functionality just makes it easier to see the data that is most important to you, and other functionality allows you to make changes to the data.

* Using the "Policy" functionality you can create your own custom search queries so that you can easily see the results by clicking one button.
* You can send email alerts to Cloud Manager users when certain critical Policies return results.
* You can add Tags to files that you want to mark for organization or for some type of follow-up.
* If you are subscribed to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/[Azure Information Protection (AIP)^] to classify and protect your files, you can use Cloud Data Sense to manage those AIP labels.
* You can delete files that seem insecure or too risky to leave in your storage system, or that you have identified as a duplicate.

NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

== Controlling your data using Policies

Policies are like a favorites list of custom filters that provide search results in the Investigation page for commonly requested compliance queries. Cloud Data Sense provides a set of predefined Policies based on common customer requests. You can create custom Policies that provide results for searches specific to your organization.

Policies provide the following functionality:

* <<List of predefined Policies,Predefined Policies>> from NetApp based on user requests
* Ability to create your own custom Policies
* Launch the Investigation page with the results from your Policies in one click
* Send email alerts to Cloud Manager users when certain critical Policies return results so you can get notifications to protect your data
* Assign AIP (Azure Information Protection) labels automatically to all files that match the criteria defined in a Policy

The *Policies* tab in the Compliance Dashboard lists all the predefined and custom Policies available on this instance of Cloud Data Sense.

image:screenshot_compliance_highlights_tab.png[A screenshot of the Policies tab in the Cloud Data Sense dashboard.]

In addition, Policies appear in the list of Filters in the Investigation page.

=== Viewing Policy results in the Investigation page

To display the results for a Policy in the Investigation page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button for a specific Policy, and then select *Investigate Results*.

image:screenshot_compliance_highlights_investigate.png[A screenshot of selecting Investigate Results for a specific Policy from the Policies tab.]

=== Creating custom Policies

You can create your own custom Policies that provide results for searches specific to your organization.

.Steps

. From the Data Investigation page, define your search by selecting all the filters you want to use. See link:task_controlling_private_data.html#filtering-data-in-the-data-investigation-page[Filtering data in the Data Investigation page^] for details.

. Once you have all the filter characteristics just the way you want them, click *Create Policy from this search*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_save_as_highlight.png[A screenshot showing how to save a filtered query as a Policy.]

. Name the Policy and select other actions that can be performed by the Policy:
.. Enter a unique name and description.
.. Optionally, check the box if you want notification emails sent to Cloud Manager users, and choose the interval at which the email is sent.
.. Optionally, check the box to automatically assign AIP labels to files that match the Policy parameters, and select the label. (Only if you have already integrated AIP labels. Learn more about <<Categorizing your data using AIP labels,AIP labels>>.)
.. Click *Create Policy*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_save_highlight.png[A screenshot that shows how to configure the Policy and save it.]

.Result

The new Policy appears in the Policies tab.

=== Editing Policies

You can modify certain parts of a Policy depending on the type of Policy:

* Custom Policies - You can modify the _Name_, the _Description_, whether email notifications are sent, and whether AIP labels are added.
* Predefined Policies - You can modify only whether email notifications are sent and whether AIP labels are added.

NOTE: If you need to change the filter parameters for a custom Policy, you'll need to create a new Policy with the parameters you want, and then delete the old Policy.

To modify a Policy, click the *Edit* button, enter your changes on the _Edit Policy_ page, and click *Save Policy*.

=== Deleting Policies

You can delete any custom Policy that you created if you no longer need it. You can't delete any of the predefined Policies.

To delete a Policy, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button for a specific Policy, click *Delete Policy*, and then click *Delete Policy* again in the confirmation dialog.

== Applying tags to manage your scanned files

You can add a tag to files that you want to mark for some type of follow-up. For example, you may have found some duplicate files and you want to delete one of them, but you need to check to see which one should be deleted. You could add a tag of "Check to delete" to the file so you know this file requires some research and some type of future action.

Data Sense enables you to view the tags that are assigned to files, add or remove tags from files, and change the name or delete an existing tag.

Note that the tag is not added to the file in the same way as AIP Labels are part of the file metadata. The tag is just seen by Cloud Manager users using Cloud Data Sense so you can see if a file needs to be deleted or checked for some type of follow-up.

TIP: Tags assigned to files in Cloud Data Sense are not related to the tags you can add to resources, such as volumes or virtual machine instances. Data Sense tags are applied at the file level.

=== Viewing files that have certain tags applied

You can view all the files that have specific tags assigned.

. Click the *Investigation* tab from Cloud Data Sense.

. In the Data Investigation page, click *Tags* in the Filters pane and then select the required tags.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_filter_status.png[A screenshot showing how to select tags from the Filters pane.]
+
The Investigation Results pane displays all the files that have those tags assigned.

=== Assigning tags to files

You can add tags to a single file or to a group of files.

To add a tag to a single file:

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

. Click the *Tags* field and the currently assigned tags are displayed.

. Add the tag or tags:
* To assign an existing tag, click in the *New Tag...* field and start typing the name of the tag. When the tag you are looking for appears, select it and press *Enter*.
* To create a new tag and assign it to the file, click in the *New Tag...* field, enter the name of the new tag, and press *Enter*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_status_manually.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a tag to a file in the Data Investigation page.]
+
The tag appears in the file metadata.

To add a tag to multiple files:

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to tag.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_tag_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files you want to tag, and the Tags button, from the Data Investigation page."]

+
* To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[]). (You can't select files from more than one page.)
* To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).

. From the button bar, click *Tags* and the currently assigned tags are displayed.

. Add the tag or tags:
* To assign an existing tag, click in the *New Tag...* field and start typing the name of the tag. When the tag you are looking for appears, select it and press *Enter*.
* To create a new tag and assign it to the file, click in the *New Tag...* field, enter the name of the new tag, and press *Enter*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_select_tags_multi.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a tag to multiple files in the Data Investigation page.]

. Approve adding the tags in the confirmation dialog and the tags are added to the metadata for all selected files.

=== Deleting tags from files

You can delete a tag if you don't need to use it anymore.

Just click the *x* for an existing tag.

image:button_delete_datasense_file_tag.png[add this somewhere in this topic]

If you had selected multiple files, the tag is removed from all the files.

== Assigning users to manage certain files

You can assign a Cloud Manager user to a specific file, or to multiple files, so that person can be responsible for any follow-up actions that need to be done on the file. This capability is often used with the feature to add custom Status tags to a file.

For example, you might have a file that contains certain personal data that allows too many users read and write access (open permissions). So you could assign the Status tag "Change permissions" and assign this file to user "Joan Smith" so they can decide how to fix the issue. When they have fixed the issue they could change the Status tag to "Completed".

Note that the user name is not added to the file as part of the file metadata - it is just seen by Cloud Manager users when using Cloud Data Sense.

A new Filter in the Investigation page enables you to easily view all files that have the same person in the "Assigned To" field.

To assign a user to a single file:

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

. Click the *Assigned to* field and select the user name.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_user_manually.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a user to a file in the Data Investigation page.]
+
The User name appears in the file metadata.

To assign a user to multiple files:

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to assign to a user.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_tag_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files you want to assign to a user, and the Assign To button, from the Data Investigation page."]

+
* To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[]). (You can't select files from more than one page.)
* To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).

. From the button bar, click *Assign to* and select the user name:
+
image:screenshot_compliance_select_user_multi.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a user to multiple files in the Data Investigation page.]
+
The user is added to the metadata for all selected files.

== Categorizing your data using AIP labels

You can manage AIP labels in the files that Cloud Data Sense is scanning if you have subscribed to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/[Azure Information Protection (AIP)^]. AIP enables you to classify and protect documents and files by applying labels to content. Data Sense enables you to view the labels that are already assigned to files, add labels to files, and change labels when a label already exists.

Cloud Data Sense supports AIP labels within the following file types: .DOC, .DOCX, .PDF, .PPTX, .XLS, .XLSX.

Note that you can't currently change labels in files larger than 30 MB. For OneDrive accounts the maximum file size is 4 MB.

TIP: If a file has a label which doesn’t exist anymore in AIP, Cloud Data Sense considers it as a file without a label.

=== Integrating AIP labels in your workspace

Before you can manage AIP labels, you need to integrate the AIP label functionality into Cloud Data Sense by signing into your existing Azure account. Once enabled, you can manage AIP labels within files for all link:concept_cloud_compliance.html#supported-working-environments-and-data-sources[working environments and data sources^] in your Cloud Manager workspace.

.Requirements

* You must have an account and an Azure Information Protection license.
* You must have the login credentials for the Azure account.
* If you plan to change labels in files that reside in Amazon S3 buckets, ensure that the permission `s3:PutObject` is included in the IAM role. See link:task_scanning_s3.html#reviewing-s3-prerequisites[setting up the IAM role^].

.Steps

. From the Cloud Data Sense Configuration page, click *Integrate AIP Labels*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_integrate_aip_labels.png[A screenshot that shows clicking the button to integrate AIP labels functionality into Cloud Data Sense.]

. In the Integrate AIP Labels dialog, click *Sign in to Azure*.

. In the Microsoft page that appears, select the account and enter the required credentials.

. Return to the Cloud Data Sense tab and you'll see the message "_AIP Labels were integrated successfully with the account <account_name>_".

. Click *Close* and you'll see the text _AIP Labels integrated_ at the top of the page.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_aip_labels_int.png[A screenshot that shows AIP labels have been successfully integrated.]

.Result

You can view and assign AIP labels from the results pane of the Investigation page. You can also assign AIP labels to files using Policies.

=== Viewing AIP labels in your files

You can view the current AIP label that is assigned to a file.

In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

image:screenshot_compliance_show_label.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a single file; including the assigned AIP label.]

=== Assigning AIP labels manually

You can add, change, and remove AIP labels from your files using Cloud Data Sense.

Follow these steps to assign an AIP label to a single file.

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_manually.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

. Click *Assign a Label to this file* and then select the label.
+
The label appears in the file metadata.

// NOTE: You can't remove a label when modifying AIP labels manually.

To assign an AIP label to multiple files:

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to label.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_tag_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files you want to label, and the Label button, from the Data Investigation page."]

+
* To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[]). (You can't select files from more than one page.)
* To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).

. From the button bar, click *Label* and select the AIP label:
+
image:screenshot_compliance_select_aip_label_multi.png[A screenshot showing how to assign an AIP label to multiple files in the Data Investigation page.]
+
The AIP label is added to the metadata for all selected files.

=== Assigning AIP labels automatically with Policies

You can assign an AIP label to all the files that meet the criteria of the Policy. You can specify the AIP label when creating the Policy, or you can add the label when editing any Policy.

Labels are added or updated in files continuously as Cloud Data Sense scans your files.

Depending on whether a label is already applied to a file, and the classification level of the label, the following actions are taken when changing a label:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="60,40"]
|===

| If the file...
| Then...

| Has no label | The label is added
| Has an existing label of a lower level of classification | The higher level label is added
| Has an existing label of a higher level of classification |	The higher level label is retained
| Is assigned a label both manually and by a Policy | The higher level label is added
| Is assigned two different labels by two Policies |	The higher level label is added

|===

Follow these steps to add an AIP label to an existing Policy.

.Steps

. From the Policies List page, click *Edit* for the Policy where you want to add (or change) the AIP label.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_1.png[A screenshot showing how to edit an existing Policy.]

. In the Edit Policy page, check the box to enable automatic labels for files that match the Policy parameters, and select the label (for example, *General*).
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_2.png[A screenshot showing how to select the label to be assigned to files that match the Policy.]

. Click *Save Policy* and the label appears in the Policy description.

NOTE: If a Policy was configured with a label, but the label has since been removed from AIP, the label name is turned to OFF and the label is not assigned anymore.

// You can remove a label by clicking the “None” option.

=== Removing the AIP integration

If you no longer want the ability to manage AIP labels in files, you can remove the AIP account from the Cloud Data Sense interface.

Note that no changes are made to the labels you have added using Data Sense. The labels that exist in files will stay as they currently exist.

.Steps

. From the _Configuration_ page, click *AIP Labels integrated > Remove Integration*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_un_integrate_aip_labels.png[A screenshot showing how to remove AIP integrations with Cloud Data Sense.]

. Click *Remove Integration* from the confirmation dialog.

== Sending email alerts when non-compliant data is found

Cloud Data Sense can send email alerts to Cloud Manager users when certain critical Policies return results so you can get notifications to protect your data. You can choose to send the email notifications on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

You can configure this setting when creating the Policy or when editing any Policy.

Follow these steps to add email updates to an existing Policy.

.Steps

. From the Policies List page, click *Edit* for the Policy where you want to add (or change) the email setting.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_email_alert_1.png[A screenshot showing how to edit an existing Policy.]

. In the Edit Policy page, check the box if you want notification emails sent to Cloud Manager users, and choose the interval at which the email is sent (for example, every *Week*).
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_email_alert_2.png[A screenshot showing how to choose the email criterial to be sent for the Policy.]

. Click *Save Policy* and the interval at which the email is sent appears in the Policy description.

.Result

The first email is sent now if there are any results from the Policy - but only if any files meet the Policy criteria. No personal information is sent in the notification emails. The email indicates that there are files that match the Policy criteria, and it provides a link to the Policy results.

== Deleting source files

You can permanently remove source files that seem insecure or too risky to leave in your storage system, or that you have identified as a duplicate. This action is permanent and there is no undo.

TIP: You can't delete files that reside in databases or files that reside in volume Backups.

.Requirements

You must have the Account Admin or Workspace Admin role to delete files.

Deleting files requires the following permissions:

*	For NFS data – the export policy needs to be defined with write permissions.
*	For CIFS data – the CIFS credentials need to have write permissions.
*	For S3 data - the IAM role must include the following permission: `s3:DeleteObject`

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to delete.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_delete_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files to delete, and the Delete button, from the Data Investigation page."]

+
* To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[]). (You can't select files from more than one page.)
* To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).

.  From the button bar, click *Delete*.

. Because the delete operation is permanent, you must type "*permanently delete*" in the subsequent _Delete File_ dialog and click *Delete File*.

Note that you can also delete an individual file when viewing the metadata details for a file. Just click *Delete this file*.

image:screenshot_compliance_delete_file.png[A screenshot showing selection of the Delete File button from the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

== Moving source files to an NFS share

You can move source files that Data Sense is scanning to any NFS share. The NFS share does not need to be integrated with Data Sense (see link:task_scanning_file_shares.html[Scanning file shares]).

TIP: You can't move files that reside in databases or files that reside in volume Backups.

.Requirements

You must have the Account Admin or Workspace Admin role to move files.

Moving files requires that the NFS share allows access from the Data Sense instance.

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to move.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_move_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files to move, and the Move button, from the Data Investigation page."]

+
* To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[]). (You can't select files from more than one page.)
* To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).

. From the button bar, click *Move*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_move_files_dialog.png[A screenshot showing the Move Files dialog so you can specify the name of the NFS share where all selected files will be moved.]

. In the _Move Files_ dialog, enter the name of the NFS share where all selected files will be moved in the format `<host_name>:/<share_path>`, and click *Move Files*.

Note that you can also move an individual file when viewing the metadata details for a file. Just click *Move file*.

image:screenshot_compliance_move_file.png[A screenshot showing selection of the Move File button from the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

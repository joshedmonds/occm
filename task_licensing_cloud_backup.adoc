A 30-day free trial of Cloud Backup starts when you enable the Cloud Backup service. When the free trial ends, you’ll need to pay for Cloud Backup using a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription through your cloud provider, an annual contract through AWS, or a bring-your-own license (BYOL) from NetApp.

A few notes before you read any further:

* If you’ve already subscribed to the Cloud Manager pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription in your cloud provider’s marketplace, then you’re automatically subscribed to Cloud Backup as well. You won’t need to subscribe again.
* The Cloud Backup bring-your-own-license (BYOL) is a floating license that you can use across all Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems associated with your Cloud Manager account.
* Backup to StorageGRID requires a BYOL license, but there's no cost for cloud provider storage space in this case.

== Use a Cloud Backup PAYGO subscription

For pay-as-you-go you'll pay your cloud provider for object storage costs and for NetApp backup licensing costs. Use these links to subscribe to Cloud Backup from your cloud provider marketplace:

* AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

* Azure: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

* GCP: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project&rif_reserved[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

== Subscribe to yearly contracts through AWS

There are two annual contracts available from the AWS Marketplace:

*	An annual contract that enables you to back up Cloud Volumes ONTAP data and on-premises ONTAP data.
+
Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B086PDWSS8[AWS Marketplace page^] to view pricing details.
+
If you want to use this option, set up your subscription from the Marketplace page and then link:task_adding_aws_accounts.html#associating-an-aws-subscription-to-credentials[associate the subscription with your AWS credentials^]. Note that you’ll also need to pay for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems using this annual contract subscription since you can assign only one active subscription to your AWS credentials in Cloud Manager.

* A Professional Package that enables you to bundle Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup by using an annual contract for 1, 2, or 3 years. Payment is per TiB. This option doesn’t enable you to back up on-premises ONTAP data.
+
Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-q7dg6zwszplri[AWS Marketplace page^] to view pricing details and go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^] to learn more about this licensing option.
+
If you want to use this option, you can set up the annual contract when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and Cloud Manager prompts you to subscribe to the AWS Marketplace.

== Use a Cloud Backup BYOL license

Bring-your-own licenses from NetApp provide 1-, 2-, or 3-year terms. You pay only for the data that you protect, calculated by the logical used capacity (_before_ ONTAP efficiencies) of the source ONTAP volumes which are being backed up. This capacity is also known as Front-End Terabytes (FETB).

The BYOL Cloud Backup license is a floating license where the total capacity is shared across all Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems associated with your Cloud Manager account. You can get a rough estimate of the capacity you'll need by running the ONTAP command `volume show-space -logical-used` for the volumes you plan to back up.

If you don’t have a Cloud Backup BYOL license, click the chat icon in the lower-right of Cloud Manager to purchase one.

You use the Digital Wallet page in Cloud Manager to manage BYOL licenses for Cloud Backup. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

=== Obtain your Cloud Backup license file

After you've purchased your Cloud Backup license, you activate the license in Cloud Manager by entering the Cloud Backup serial number and NSS account, or by uploading the NLF license file. The steps below show how to get the NLF license file if you plan to use that method.
//
// If you're running Cloud Backup in an on-premises site that doesn’t have internet access, meaning that you’ve deployed the Cloud Manager Connector on a host in the offline on-premises site, you’ll need to obtain the license file from an internet-connected system. Activating the license using the serial number and NSS account is not available for offline (dark site) installations.

.Steps

. Sign in to the https://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support Site^] and click *Systems > Software Licenses*.

. Enter your Cloud Backup license serial number.
+

. In the *License Key* column, click *Get NetApp License File*.

. Enter your Cloud Manager Account ID (this is called a Tenant ID on the support site) and click *Submit* to download the license file.
+

+
You can find your Cloud Manager Account ID by selecting the *Account* drop-down from the top of Cloud Manager, and then clicking *Manage Account* next to your account. Your Account ID is in the Overview tab.

=== Add Cloud Backup BYOL licenses to your account

After you purchase a Cloud Backup license for your NetApp account, you need to add the license to Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Data Services Licenses*.

. Click *Add License*.

. In the _Add License_ dialog, enter the license information and click *Add License*:
+
* If you have the backup license serial number and know your NSS account, select the *Enter Serial Number* option and enter that information.
+
If your NetApp Support Site account isn't available from the drop-down list, link:task_adding_nss_accounts.html[add the NSS account to Cloud Manager].
* If you have the backup license file, select the *Upload License File* option and follow the prompts to attach the file.
+

.Result

Cloud Manager adds the license so that Cloud Backup is active.

=== Update a Cloud Backup BYOL license

If your licensed term is nearing the expiration date, or if your licensed capacity is reaching the limit, you'll be notified in the Backup UI. This status also appears in the Digital Wallet page and in link:task_monitor_cm_operations.html#monitoring-operations-status-using-the-notification-center[Notifications].

image:screenshot_services_license_expire.png[A screenshot that shows an expiring license in the Digital Wallet page.]

You can update your Cloud Backup license before it expires so that there is no interruption in your ability to back up and restore your data.

.Steps

. Click the chat icon in the lower-right of Cloud Manager, or contact Support, to request an extension to your term or additional capacity to your Cloud Backup license for the particular serial number.
+
After you pay for the license and it is registered with the NetApp Support Site, Cloud Manager automatically updates the license in the Digital Wallet and the Data Services Licenses page will reflect the change in 5 to 10 minutes.

. If Cloud Manager can't automatically update the license (for example, when installed in a dark site), then you’ll need to manually upload the license file.
.. You can <<Obtain your Cloud Backup license file,obtain the license file from the NetApp Support Site>>.
.. On the Digital Wallet page in _Data Services Licenses_ tab, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the service serial number you are updating, and click *Update License*.
+
image:screenshot_services_license_update1.png[A screenshot of selecting the Update License button for a particular service.]

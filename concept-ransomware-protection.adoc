TIP: The Ransomware Protection service is currently a Beta offering.

== Features

Ransomware Protection currently provides several features that can help you with your cyberstorage protection efforts. Additional features will be added each month. Current features identify when:

* Volumes in your working environments aren't being protected using link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup].
* Data in your working environments and imported data sources aren't being scanned using link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense] to identify compliance and privacy concerns, and find optimization opportunities.
* An abnormal increase in the percentage of encrypted files in a working environment or data source has occurred.
+
This can be an indicator that a ransomware attack has commenced on your network.
* Sensitive data is found in files and the access permissions level is too high in a working environment or data source.

When using Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, there are some additional ransomware protections you can deploy directly from the working environment. link:task_protecting_ransomware.html[See how to add additional protection against ransomware].

== Supported working environments and data sources

Cloud Data Sense is a prerequisite to using the Ransomware Protection service. After Data Sense is installed and activated, you can use Ransomware Protection to see how resilient your data is to a cyber attack on the following types of working environments and data sources:

*Working environments:*

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP (deployed in AWS, Azure, or GCP)
* On-premises ONTAP clusters
* Azure NetApp Files
* Amazon FSx for ONTAP
* Amazon S3

*Data sources:*

* Non-NetApp file shares
* Object storage (that uses S3 protocol)
* Databases
* OneDrive accounts
* SharePoint accounts

== How Ransomware Protection works

At a high-level, Ransomware Protection works like this:

. Cloud Data Sense scans your corporate on-premises and cloud data sources and working environments to map and classify data.
. Ransomware Protection gathers information from Data Sense, Cloud Backup, and from other Cloud Manager resources, to populate the Ransomware Protection Dashboard.
. You use the Dashboard to gather an overview of how well protected your systems are.
. You use the provided reporting tools to help in your cyberstorage protection efforts.

== Cost

There is no cost during the Beta cycle.

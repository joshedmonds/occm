Gain control of your private data by viewing details about the personal data and sensitive personal data in your organization. You can also gain visibility by reviewing the categories and file types that Cloud Data Sense found in your data.

NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

By default, the Cloud Data Sense dashboard displays compliance data for all working environments and databases.

image:screenshot_compliance_dashboard.png[A screenshot of the Cloud Data Sense dashboard]

If you want to see data for only some of the working environments, <<Viewing Dashboard data for specific working environments,select those working environments>>.

You can also filter the results from the Data Investigation page and download a report of the results as a CSV file. See <<Filtering data in the Data Investigation page,Filtering data in the Data Investigation page>> for details.

== Viewing files that contain personal data

Cloud Data Sense automatically identifies specific words, strings, and patterns (Regex) inside the data. For example, Personal Identification Information (PII), credit card numbers, social security numbers, bank account numbers, and more. link:reference_private_data_categories.html#types-of-personal-data[See the full list^].

Additionally, if you have added a database server to be scanned, the _Data Fusion_ feature allows you to scan your files to identify whether unique identifiers from your databases are found in those files or other databases. See link:task_managing_data_fusion.html[Adding personal data identifiers using Data Fusion^] for details.

For some types of personal data, Data Sense uses _proximity validation_ to validate its findings. The validation occurs by looking for one or more predefined keywords in proximity to the personal data that was found. For example, Data Sense identifies a U.S. social security number (SSN) as a SSN if it sees a proximity word next to it--for example, _SSN_ or _social security_. link:reference_private_data_categories.html#types-of-personal-data[The table of personal data^] shows when Data Sense uses proximity validation.

.Steps

== Viewing files that contain sensitive personal data

Cloud Data Sense automatically identifies special types of sensitive personal information, as defined by privacy regulations such as https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e2051-1-1[articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR^]. For example, information regarding a person's health, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation. link:reference_private_data_categories.html#types-of-sensitive-personal-data[See the full list^].

Cloud Data Sense uses artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and cognitive computing (CC) to understand the meaning of the content that it scans in order to extract entities and categorize it accordingly.

For example, one sensitive GDPR data category is ethnic origin. Because of its NLP abilities, Data Sense can distinguish the difference between a sentence that reads "George is Mexican" (indicating sensitive data as specified in article 9 of the GDPR), versus "George is eating Mexican food."

NOTE: Only English is supported when scanning for sensitive personal data. Support for more languages will be added later.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Data Sense* and click the *Compliance* tab.

. To investigate the details for all sensitive personal data, click the icon next to the sensitive personal data percentage.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_sensitive_personal.gif[A screenshot of selecting the sensitive personal data percentage.]

. To investigate the details for a specific type of sensitive personal data, click *View All* and then click the *Investigate Results* icon for a specific type of sensitive personal data.
+
image:screenshot_sensitive_personal_files.gif[A screenshot of the sensitive personal files dialog box where you can click the Investigate Results icon next to a personal data type.]

. Investigate the data by searching, sorting, expanding details for a specific file, clicking *Investigate Results* to see masked information, or by downloading the file list.

== Viewing files by categories

Cloud Data Sense takes the data that it scanned and divides it into different types of categories. Categories are topics based on AI analysis of the content and metadata of each file. link:reference_private_data_categories.html#types-of-categories[See the list of categories^].

Categories can help you understand what's happening with your data by showing you the types of information that you have. For example, a category like resumes or employee contracts can include sensitive data. When you investigate the results, you might find that employee contracts are stored in an insecure location. You can then correct that issue.

NOTE: English, German, and Spanish are supported for categories. Support for more languages will be added later.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Data Sense* and click the *Compliance* tab.

. Click the *Investigate Results* icon for one of the top 4 categories directly from the main screen, or click *View All* and then click the icon for any of the categories.
+
image:screenshot_categories.gif[A screenshot of the categories dialog box where you can click the Investigate Results icon next to a category.]

. Investigate the data by searching, sorting, expanding details for a specific file, clicking *Investigate Results* to see masked information, or by downloading the file list.

== Viewing files by file types

Cloud Data Sense takes the data that it scanned and breaks it down by file type. Reviewing your file types can help you control your sensitive data because you might find that certain file types are not stored correctly. link:reference_private_data_categories.html#types-of-files[See the list of file types^].

For example, you might be storing CAD files that include very sensitive information about your organization. If they are unsecured, you can take control of the sensitive data by restricting permissions or moving the files to another location.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Data Sense* and click the *Compliance* tab.

. Click the *Investigate Results* icon for one of the top 4 file types directly from the main screen, or click *View All* and then click the icon for any of the file types.
+
image:screenshot_file_types.gif[A screenshot of the file types dialog box where you can click the Investigate Results icon next to a file type.]

. Investigate the data by searching, sorting, expanding details for a specific file, clicking *Investigate Results* to see masked information, or by downloading the file list.

== Viewing file metadata

In the Data Investigation results pane you can click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for any single file to view the file metadata.

image:screenshot_compliance_file_details.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

In addition to showing you the working environment and volume where the file resides, the metadata shows much more information, including the file permissions, file owner, whether there are duplicates of this file, and assigned AIP label (if you have link:task_managing_highlights.html#categorizing-your-data-using-aip-labels[integrated AIP in Cloud Data Sense^]). This information is useful if you're planning to link:task_managing_highlights.html#creating-custom-policies[create Policies] because you can see all the information that you can use to filter your data.

Note that not all information is available for all data sources - just what is appropriate for that data source. For example, volume name, permissions, and AIP labels are not relevant for database files.

When viewing the details for a single file there are a few actions you can take on the file:

* You can move or copy the file to any NFS share. See link:task_managing_highlights.html#moving-source-files-to-an-nfs-share[Moving source files to an NFS share] and link:task_managing_highlights.html#copying-source-files[Copying source files to an NFS share] for details.

* You can delete the file. See link:task_managing_highlights.html#deleting-source-files[Deleting source files] for details.

* You can assign a certain Status to the file. See link:task_managing_highlights.html#applying-status-tags-to-manage-your-scanned-files[Applying Status tags] for details.

* You can assign the file to a Cloud Manager user to be responsible for any follow-up actions that need to be done on the file. See link:task_managing_highlights.html#assigning-users-to-manage-certain-files[Assigning users to a file] for details.

* If you have integrated AIP labels with Cloud Data Sense, you can assign a label to this file, or change to a different label if one already exists. See link:task_managing_highlights.html#assigning-aip-labels-manually[Assigning AIP labels manually^] for details.

== Viewing permissions for files

To view a list of all users or groups who have access to a file, and the types of permissions they have, click *View all Permissions*.

image:screenshot_compliance_permissions.png[A screenshot showing detailed file permissions.]

This button is available only for files in CIFS shares.

Note that if you see SIDs (Security IDentifiers) instead of user and group names, you should integrate your Active Directory into Data Sense. link:task-add-active-directory-datasense.html[See how to do this]. 

== Checking for duplicate files in your storage systems

You can view if duplicate files are being stored in your storage systems. This is useful if you want to identify areas where you can save storage space. It can also be helpful to make sure certain files that have specific permissions or sensitive information are not unnecessarily duplicated in your storage systems.

You can download the list of duplicate files and send it to your storage admin so they can decide which files, if any, can be deleted. Or you can link:task_managing_highlights.html#deleting-source-files[delete the file^] yourself if you are confident that a specific version of the file is not needed.

=== Viewing all duplicated files

If you want a list of all files that are duplicated in the working environments and data sources you are scanning, you can use the filter called *Duplicates > Has duplicates* in the Data Investigation page.

All files with duplicates from all file types (not including databases), with a minimum size of 50 MB, and/or containing personal or sensitive personal information, will show in the Results page.

=== Viewing if a specific file is duplicated

If you want to see if a single file has duplicates, in the Data Investigation results pane you can click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for any single file to view the file metadata. If there are duplicates of a certain file, this information appears next to the _Duplicates_ field.

To view the list of duplicate files and where they are located, click *View Details*. In the next page click *View Duplicates* to view the files in the Investigation page.

image:screenshot_compliance_duplicate_file.png[A screenshot showing how to view where duplicated files are located.]

TIP: You can use the "file hash" value provided in this page and enter it directly in the Investigation page to search for a specific duplicate file at any time - or to be used in a Policy.

== Viewing Dashboard data for specific working environments

You can filter the contents of the Cloud Data Sense dashboard to see compliance data for all working environments and databases, or for just specific working environments.

When you filter the dashboard, Data Sense scopes the compliance data and reports to just those working environments that you selected.

.Steps

. Click the filter drop-down, select the working environments that you'd like to view data for, and click *View*.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_filter.gif[A screenshot showing how to filter the investigation results for specific working environments.]

== Filtering data in the Data Investigation page

You can filter the contents of the investigation page to display only the results you want to see. If you want to save a CSV version of the content as a report after you have refined it, click the image:button_download.png[download button] button.

image:screenshot_compliance_investigation_filtered.png[A screenshot of the filters available when refining the results in the investigation page.]

* The top-level tabs allow you to view data from files (unstructured data) or from databases (structured data).

* The controls at the top of each column allow you to sort the results in numerical or alphabetical order.

* The left-pane filters enable you to refine the results by selecting from the following attributes:

** Policies
** Open Permissions
** File Owner
** Label
** Working Environment Type (note that OneDrive is categorized under "Cloud Apps")
** Working Environment name
** Storage Repository (for example, a volume or a schema)
** File Path
** Category
** Sensitivity Level
** Personal Data
** Sensitive Personal Data
** Data Subject
** File Type
** File Size
** Created Time
** Last Modified
** Last Accessed (For the link:reference_private_data_categories.html#types-of-files[types of files that we scan for content] this is the last time Data Sense scanned the file.)
** Duplicates
** File Hash
** Tags
** Assigned To

* The _Policies_ filter at the top of the Filters pane lists the custom filters that provide commonly requested combinations of filters; like a saved database query or Favorites list. Go link:task_managing_highlights.html#controlling-your-data-using-policies[here^] to view the list of predefined Policies and to see how you can create your own custom Policies.

== What’s included in each file list report (CSV file)

From each Investigation page you can click the image:button_download.png[download button] button to download file lists (in CSV format) that include details about the identified files. If Data Sense is scanning both Structured (database tables) and Unstructured (files) data, there are two reports contained in the downloaded ZIP file.

If there are more than 10,000 results, only the top 10,000 appear in the list.

The *Unstructured Data Report* includes the following information:

* File name
* Location type
* Working environment type
* Working environment name
* Storage repository (for example, a volume)
* Protocol type
* File path
* File type
* File size
* Created time
* Discovered time (when Data Sense first discovered the file)
* Last modified
* Last accessed
* File owner
* Category
* Personal information
* Sensitive personal information
* Deletion detection date
+
A deletion detection date identifies the date that the file was deleted or moved. This enables you to identify when sensitive files have been moved. Deleted files aren't part of the file number count that appears in the dashboard or on the Investigation page. The files only appear in the CSV reports.

The *Structured Data Report* includes the following information:

* DB Table name
* Location type
* Working environment type
* Working environment name
* Storage repository (for example, a schema)
* Column count
* Row count
* Personal information
* Sensitive personal information

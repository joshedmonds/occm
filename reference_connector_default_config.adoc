If you need to troubleshoot the Connector, it might help to understand how it's configured.

== Default configuration with internet access

* If you deployed the Connector from Cloud Manager (or directly from a cloud provider's marketplace), note the following:

** In AWS, the user name for the EC2 Linux instance is ec2-user.

** The operating system for the image is as follows:
*** AWS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 (HVM)
*** Azure: CentOS 7.6
*** GCP: CentOS 7.9
+
The operating system does not include a GUI. You must use a terminal to access the system.

* The Connector installation folder resides in the following location:
+
/opt/application/netapp/cloudmanager

* Log files are contained in the following folders:
+
** /opt/application/netapp/cloudmanager/log
+
The logs in this folder provide details about the Connector and docker images.

** /opt/application/netapp/cloudmanager/docker_occm/data/log
+
The logs in this folder provide details about cloud services and the Cloud Manager service that runs on the Connector.

* The Cloud Manager service is named occm.

* The occm service is dependent on the MySQL service.
+
If the MySQL service is down, then the occm service is down too.

* Cloud Manager installs the following packages on the Linux host, if they are not already installed:
** 7Zip
** AWSCLI
** Docker
** Java
** Kubectl
** MySQL
** Tridentctl
** Pull
** Wget

* The Connector uses the following ports on the Linux host:
** 80 for HTTP access
** 443 for HTTPS access
** 3306 for the Cloud Manager database
** 8080 for the Cloud Manager API proxy
** 8666 for the Service Manager API
** 8777 for the Health-Checker Container Service API

== Default configuration without internet access

The following configuration applies if you manually installed the Connector on an on-premises Linux host that doesn't have internet access. link:task-install-connector-onprem-no-internet.html[Learn more about this installation option].

* The Connector installation folder resides in the following location:
+
/opt/application/netapp/ds

* Log files are contained in the following folders:
+
/var/lib/docker/volumes/ds_occmdata/_data/log
+
The logs in this folder provide details about the Connector and docker images.

* All services are running inside docker containers
+
The services are dependent on the docker runtime service running

* The Connector uses the following ports on the Linux host:

** 80 for HTTP access
** 443 for HTTPS access

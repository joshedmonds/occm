Cloud Backup supports two S3 archival storage classes and most regions.

== Supported S3 archival storage classes for Cloud Backup

When backup files are initially created they're stored in S3 _Standard_ storage. This tier is optimized for storing data that's infrequently accessed; but that also allows you to access it immediately. After 30 days the backups transition to the S3 _Standard-Infrequent Access_ storage class to save on costs.

If your source clusters are running ONTAP 9.10.1 or greater, you can choose to tier backups to either _S3 Glacier_ or _S3 Glacier Deep Archive_ storage after a certain number of days (typically more than 30 days) for further cost optimization. Data in these tiers can't be accessed immediately when needed, and will require a higher retrieval cost, so you need to consider how often you may need to restore data from these archived backup files. See the next section about <<Restoring data from archival storage,restoring data from archival storage>>.

Note that when you configure Cloud Backup with this type of lifecycle rule, you must not configure any lifecycle rules when setting up the bucket in your AWS account.

== Restoring data from archival storage

While storing older backup files in archival storage is much less expensive than Standard or Standard-IA storage, accessing data from a backup file in archive storage for restore operations will take a longer amount of time and will cost more money.

How much does it cost to restore data from Amazon S3 Glacier and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive?::
There are 3 restore priorities you can choose when retrieving data from Amazon S3 Glacier:

* *High*: Fastest retrieval, higher cost
* *Standard*: Slower retrieval, lower cost
* *Low*: Slowest retrieval, lowest cost

+
There are 2 restore priorities you can choose when retrieving data from Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive:

* *Standard*: Faster retrieval, higher cost
* *Low*: Slower retrieval, lowest cost

+
Each method has a different per-GB retrieval fee and per-request fee. For detailed S3 Glacier pricing by AWS Region, visit the https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/[Amazon S3 pricing page].

How long will it take to restore my objects archived in Amazon S3 Glacier?::
There are 2 parts that make up the total restore time:

* *Retrieval time*: The time to retrieve the archived backup file from archive and place it in Standard storage. The retrieval time is different depending on the restore priority you choose.

| Archive Tier
3+^| Restore Priority & Retrieval Time

| | *High* | *Standard* | *Low*
| *S3 Glacier* | 3-5 minutes | 3-5 hours | 5-12 hours
| *S3 Glacier Deep Archive* |  | 12 hours | 48 hours

|===

* *Restore time*: The time to restore the data from the backup file in Standard storage. This time is no different than the typical restore operation directly from Standard storage - when not using an archival tier.

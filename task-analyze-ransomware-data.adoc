== Cyber Resilience Map

The Cyber Resilience Map is the main area in the dashboard. It enables you to see all your working environments and data sources in a visual manner and be able to view relevant cyber-resilience information.

image:screenshot_ransomware_cyber_map.png[A screenshot of the Cyber Resilience Map on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

The map consists of three parts:

Left panel::
Shows a list of alerts for which the service is monitoring across all of your data sources. It also indicates the number of each particular alert that is active in your environment. Having a large number of one type of alert may be a good reason to try to resolve those alerts first.
Center panel::
Shows all of your data sources, services, and Active Directory in a graphical format. Healthy environments have a green indicator and environments that have alerts have a red indicator.
Right panel::
After you click on a data source that has a red indicator, this panel shows the alerts for that data source and provides recommendations to resolve the alert. Alerts are sorted so that the most recent alerts are listed first. Many recommendations lead you to another Cloud Manager service where you can resolve the issue.

These are the currently tracked alerts and suggested remediations.

| Alert
| Description
| Remediation

| High data encryption rates detected
| An abnormal increase in the percentage of encrypted files, or corrupted files, in the data source has occurred. This means that there was a greater than 20% increase in the percentage of encrypted files in the past 7 days. For example, if 50% of your files are encrypted, then a day later this number increases to 60%, you would see this alert.
| Click the link to launch the link:task_controlling_private_data.html#filtering-data-in-the-data-investigation-page[Data Sense Investigation page]. There you can select the filters for the specific _Working Environment_ and _Category (Encrypted and Corrupted)_ to view the list of all encrypted and corrupted files.

| Sensitive data with wide permissions found
| Sensitive data is found in files and the access permissions level is too high in a data source.
| Click the link to launch the link:task_controlling_private_data.html#filtering-data-in-the-data-investigation-page[Data Sense Investigation page]. There you can select the filters for the specific _Working Environment_, _Sensitivity Level (Sensitive Personal)_, and _Open Permissions_ to view the list of the files that have this issue.

| One or more volumes are not backed up using Cloud Backup
| Some volumes in the working environment aren't being protected using link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup].
| Click the link to launch Cloud Backup and then you can identify the volumes that aren't being backed up in the working environment, and then decide if you want to enable backups on those volumes.

| One or more repositories (volumes, buckets, etc.) in your data sources are not being scanned by Data Sense
| Some data in your data sources isn't being scanned using link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense] to identify compliance and privacy concerns and find optimization opportunities.
| Click the link to launch Data Sense and enable scanning and mapping for the items that are not being scanned.

| Your ONTAP system is not hardened
| Certain settings in your ONTAP system are not set in accordance with recommendations from the https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/10674-tr4569.pdf[NetApp Security Hardening Guide for ONTAP Systems].
| Click the link and you are redirected to the <<Status of ONTAP systems hardening,Harden your ONTAP environment panel>> below so you can investigate which issue is causing the alert and how best to fix the issue.

|===

== Top data repositories by data sensitivity

The _Top Data Repositories by Sensitivity Level_ panel lists up to the top four data repositories (working environments and data sources) that contain the most sensitive items. The bar chart for each working environment is divided into:

* Non-Sensitive data
* Personal data
* Sensitive Personal data

image:screenshot_ransomware_sensitivity.png[A screenshot of the data sensitivity chart on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

You can hover over each section to see the total number of items in each category.

Click each area to view the filtered results in the Data Sense Investigation page so that you can investigate further.

== Domain Administrator Group control

The _Domain Administrator Group control_ panel shows the most recent five users who have been added into your domain administrator groups so that you can see if all the users should be allowed in those groups. You must have link:task-add-active-directory-datasense.html[integrated a global Active Directory] into Cloud Data Sense for this panel to be active.

image:screenshot_ransomware_domain_admin.png[A screenshot of the users who have been added as domain admins on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

The default administrative admin groups include “Administrators”, “Domain Admins”, “Enterprise Admins”, “Enterprise Key Admins”, and “Key Admins”.

== Data listed by types of open permissions

The _Open permissions_ panel shows the percentage for each type of permission that exist for all files that are being scanned. The chart is provided from Data Sense and it shows the following types of permissions:

* No Open Access
* Open to Organization
* Open to Public
* Unknown Access

image:screenshot_ransomware_permissions.png[A screenshot of the encrypted file chart on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

You can hover over each section to see the percentage and total number of files in each category.

Click each area to view the filtered results in the Data Sense Investigation page so that you can investigate further.

== Data listed by encrypted files

The _Encrypted files_ panel shows the top 4 data sources with the highest percentage of files that are encrypted, over time. These are typically items that have been password protected. It does this by comparing the encryption rates over the past 7 days to see which data sources have a greater than 20% increase. An increase of this amount could mean that ransomware is already attacked your system.

image:screenshot_ransomware_encrypt_files.png[A screenshot of the encrypted file chart on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

Click a line for one of the data sources to view the filtered results in the Data Sense Investigation page so that you can investigate further.

== Status of ONTAP systems hardening

The _Harden your ONTAP environment_ panel provides the status of certain settings in your ONTAP systems that track how secure your deployment is according to the https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/10674-tr4569.pdf[NetApp Security Hardening Guide for ONTAP Systems] and to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[ONTAP anti-ransomware feature] that proactively detects and warns about abnormal activity.

You can review the recommendations and then decide how you want to address the potential issues. You can follow the steps to change the settings on your clusters, defer the changes to another time, or ignore the suggestion.

image:screenshot_ransomware_harden_ontap.png[A screenshot of the status for ONTAP hardening on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

The settings that are being tracked include:

For clusters that have low numbers for certain categories, you can click the System Manager button at the end of each row to correct the issue. You can also click the Cloud Backup button to activate backups for the volumes, or the Data Sense button to scan the volumes on the clusters to investigate compliance and governance conformance.

== Status of permissions on your critical business data

The _Business critical data permissions analysis_ panel shows the permissions status of data that is critical for your business. That way you can quickly assess how well you are protecting your business critical data.

image:screenshot_ransomware_critical_permissions.png[A screenshot of the permissions status for the data you are managing on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

Initially this panel has no data because the data gets populated only after you select the Data Sense _Policies_ that you have created to view your most critical business data. See how to link:task-org-private-data.html#creating-custom-policies[create your policies using Data Sense].

After you have added up to 2 policies to this panel, the graph shows a permission analysis of all the data that meets the criteria from your policy. It lists the number of items that are:

* Open to public permissions – the items which Data Sense considers as open to public
* Open to organization permissions – the items which Data Sense considers as open to organization
* No open permissions – the items which Data Sense considers as no open permissions
* Unknown permissions– the items which Data Sense considers as unknown permissions

Hover over each bar in the charts to view the number of results in each category. Click a bar and the Data Sense Investigation page is displayed so you can investigate further about which items have open permissions and whether you should make any adjustments to file permissions.

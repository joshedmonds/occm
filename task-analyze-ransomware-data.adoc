Use the Ransomware Protection dashboard to view an overview of the cyber resilience of all your working environments and data sources. You can drill down in each area to find more details and possible remediations.

== Cyber Resilience Map

The Cyber Resilience Map is the main area in the dashboard. It enables you to see all your working environments and data sources in a visual manner and be able to view relevant cyber-resilience information.

image:screenshot_ransomware_cyber_map.png[A screenshot of the Cyber Resilience Map on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

The map consists of three parts:

Left panel::
Shows a list of alerts for which the service is monitoring across all of your data sources. It also indicates the number of each particular alert that is active in your environment. Having a large number of one type of alert may be a good reason to try to resolve those alerts first.
Center panel::
Shows all of your data sources, services, and Active Directory in a graphical format. Healthy environments have a green indicator and environments that have alerts have a red indicator.
Right panel::
After you click on a data source that has a red indicator, this panel shows the alerts for that data source and provides recommendations to resolve the alert. Alerts are sorted so that the most recent alerts are listed first. Many recommendations lead you to another Cloud Manager service where you can resolve the issue.

These are the currently tracked alerts and suggested remediations.

|===
| Alert
| Description
| Remediation

| High data encryption rates detected
| An abnormal increase in the percentage of encrypted files, or corrupted files, in the data source has occurred. This means that there was a greater than 20% increase in the percentage of encrypted files in the past 7 days. For example, if 50% of your files are encrypted, then a day later this number increases to 60%, you would see this alert.
| Click the link to launch the link:task_controlling_private_data.html#filtering-data-in-the-data-investigation-page[Data Sense Investigation page]. There you can select the filters for the specific _Working Environment_ and _Category (Encrypted and Corrupted)_ to view the list of all encrypted and corrupted files.

| Sensitive data with wide permissions found
| Sensitive data is found in files and the access permissions level is too high in a data source.
| Click the link to launch the link:task_controlling_private_data.html#filtering-data-in-the-data-investigation-page[Data Sense Investigation page]. There you can select the filters for the specific _Working Environment_, _Sensitivity Level (Sensitive Personal)_, and _Open Permissions_ to view the list of the files that have this issue.

| One or more volumes are not backed up using Cloud Backup
| Some volumes in the working environment aren't being protected using link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup].
| Click the link to launch Cloud Backup and then you can identify the volumes that aren't being backed up in the working environment, and then decide if you want to enable backups on those volumes.

| One or more repositories (volumes, buckets, etc.) in your data sources are not being scanned by Data Sense
| Some data in your data sources isn't being scanned using link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense] to identify compliance and privacy concerns and find optimization opportunities.
| Click the link to launch Data Sense and enable scanning and mapping for the items that are not being scanned.

== Top data repositories by data sensitivity

The _Top Data Repositories by Sensitivity Level_ area lists up to the top four data repositories (working environments and data sources) that contain the most sensitive items. The bar chart for each working environment is divided into:

* Non-Sensitive data
* Personal data
* Sensitive Personal data

You can hover over each section to see the total number of items in each category.

Click each area to view the filtered results in the Data Sense Investigation page so that you can investigate further.

== Domain Administrator Group control

The _Domain Administrator Group control_ area shows the most recent five users who have been added into your domain administrator groups so that you can see if all the users should be allowed in those groups. You must have link:task-add-active-directory-datasense.html[integrated a global Active Directory] into Cloud Data Sense for this panel to be active.

image:screenshot_ransomware_domain_admin.png[A screenshot of the users who have been added as domain admins on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

The default administrative admin groups include “Administrators”, “Domain Admins”, “Enterprise Admins”, “Enterprise Key Admins”, and “Key Admins”.

== Data listed by types of open permissions

The _Open Permissions_ area shows the percentage for each type of permission that exist for all files that are being scanned. The chart is provided from Data Sense and it shows the following types of permissions:

* No Open Access
* Open to Organization
* Open to Public
* Unknown Access

image:screenshot_ransomware_permissions.png[A screenshot of the encrypted file chart on the Ransomware Protection dashboard.]

You can hover over each section to see the percentage and total number of files in each category.

Click each area to view the filtered results in the Data Sense Investigation page so that you can investigate further.

TIP: Files in OneDrive accounts, SharePoint accounts, and in databases are not represented in this chart.

== Data listed by encrypted files

The _Encrypted Files_ area shows the top 4 data sources with the highest percentage of files that are encrypted, over time. These are typically items that have been password protected. It does this by comparing the encryption rates over the past 7 days to see which data sources have a greater than 20% increase. An increase of this amount could mean that ransomware is already attacked your system.

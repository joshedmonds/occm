You can manage sync relationships at any time by immediately syncing data, changing schedules, and more.

== Performing an immediate data sync

Rather than wait for the next scheduled sync, you can press a button to immediately sync data between the source and target.

.Steps

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and click image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Click *Sync Now* and then click *Sync* to confirm.

.Result

Cloud Sync starts the data sync process for the relationship.

== Accelerating sync performance

Accelerate the performance of a sync relationship by adding an additional data broker to the group that manages the relationship. The additional data broker must be a _new_ data broker.

.How this works

If the data broker group manages other sync relationships, then the new data broker that you add to the group also accelerates the performance of those sync relationships.

For example, let's say you have three relationships:

* Relationship 1 is managed by data broker group A
* Relationship 2 is managed by data broker group B
* Relationship 3 is managed by data broker group A

You want to accelerate the performance of relationship 1 so you add a new data broker to data broker group A. Because group A also manages sync relationship 3, the sync performance for relationship is automatically accelerated as well..

.Steps

. Ensure that at least one of the existing data brokers in the relationship are online.

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and click image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Click *Accelerate*.

. Follow the prompts to create a new data broker.

.Result

Cloud Sync adds the new data broker to the group. The performance of the next data sync should be accelerated.

== Updating credentials

You can update the data broker with the latest credentials of the source or target in an existing sync relationship. Updating the credentials can help if your security policies require you to update credentials on a periodic basis.

Updating credentials is supported with any source or target that Cloud Sync requires credentials for: Azure Blob, Box, IBM Cloud Object Storage, StorageGRID, ONTAP S3 Storage, SFTP, and SMB servers.

.Steps

. From the *Sync Dashboard*, go to a sync relationship that requires credentials and then click *Update Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot_sync_update_credentials.png[A screenshot that shows the Update Credentials option on the Sync Relationships page just under the name of the source or target.]

. Enter the credentials and click *Update*.
+
A note about SMB servers: if the domain is new, then you'll need to specify it when you update the credentials. If the domain hasn't changed, then you don't need to enter it again.
+
If you entered a domain when you created the sync relationship, but you don't enter a new domain when you update the credentials, then Cloud Sync will keep using the original domain that you provided.

.Result

Cloud Sync updates the credentials on the data broker. It can take up 10 minutes until the data broker starts using the updated credentials for data syncs.

== Changing the settings for a sync relationship

Modify settings that define how source files and folders are synced and maintained in the target location.

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and click image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Click *Settings*.

. Modify any of the settings.

+
[[deleteonsource]] Here's a brief description of each setting:
+
Schedule:: Choose a recurring schedule for future syncs or turn off the sync schedule. You can schedule a relationship to sync data as often as every 1 minute.

Retries:: Define the number of times that Cloud Sync should retry to sync a file before skipping it.

Compare By:: Choose whether Cloud Sync should compare certain attributes when determining whether a file or directory has changed and should be synced again.
+
Even if you uncheck these attributes, Cloud Sync still compares the source to the target by checking the paths, file sizes, and file names. If there are any changes, then it syncs those files and directories.
+
You can choose to enable or disable Cloud Sync from comparing the following attributes:
+
* *mtime*: The last modified time for a file. This attribute isn't valid for directories.
* *uid*, *gid*, and *mode*: Permission flags for Linux.

Copy for Objects:: You can't edit this option after you create the relationship.

Recently Modified Files:: Choose to exclude files that were recently modified prior to the scheduled sync.

Delete Files on Source::
Choose to delete files from the source location after Cloud Sync copies the files to the target location. This option includes the risk of data loss because the source files are deleted after they're copied.
+
If you enable this option, you also need to change a parameter in the local.json file on the data broker. Open the file and update it as follows:
+
[source,json]
{
"workers":{
"transferrer":{
"delete-on-source": true
}
}
}

Delete Files on Target:: Choose to delete files from the target location, if they were deleted from the source. The default is to never deletes files from the target location.

File Types:: Define the file types to include in each sync: files, directories, and symbolic links.

Exclude File Extensions:: Specify file extensions to exclude from the sync by typing the file extension and pressing *Enter*. For example, type _log_ or _.log_ to exclude *.log files. A separator isn't required for multiple extensions. The following video provides a short demo:
+
video::video_file_extensions.mp4[width=840, height=240]

File Size:: Choose to sync all files regardless of their size or just files that are in a specific size range.

Date Modified:: Choose all files regardless of their last modified date, files modified after a specific date, before a specific date, or between a time range.

Date Created:: When an SMB server is the source, this setting enables you to sync files that were created after a specific date, before a specific date, or between a specific time range.

ACL - Access Control List:: Copy ACLs from an SMB server by enabling a setting when you create a relationship or after you create a relationship.

. Click *Save Settings*.

.Result

Cloud Sync modifies the sync relationship with the new settings.

== Deleting relationships

You can delete a sync relationship, if you no longer need to sync data between the source and target. This action doesn't delete the data broker group (or the individual data broker instances) and it does not delete data from the target.

.Steps

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and click image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Click *Delete* and then click *Delete* again to confirm.

.Result

Cloud Sync deletes the sync relationship.

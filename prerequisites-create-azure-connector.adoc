[.lead]
Before you create a Connector in Azure from Cloud Manager, you should ensure certain things.

* Ensure that the subnet chosen for the Connector should not overlap with the following IP address ranges reserved for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): 169.254.0.0/16, 172.30.0.0/16, 172.31.0.0/16, and 192.0.2.0/24.
* Ensure that there are no AKS running in the chosen subnet.
* Ensure that the chosen subnet has outbound network connectivity to the internet.
* Ensure that the chosen subnet can access the SAP HANA systems on the respective ports.
* If the VNet of the chosen subnet is different from the VNet of the SAP HANA systems, ensure that the VNets can communicate with each other through VPN gateway, peering, or other means.
* Ensure that the VNet of the chosen subnet is configured with default (Azure provided) DNS Server.
+
Custom DNS servers are not supported if you are planning to install the Connector without public IP.
* If you want to enable SnapCenter Service behind Azure firewall, you should perform the actions mentioned in <<Network requirements>>.
+
You should upfront decide whether you want to enable SnapCenter Service behind Azure firewall. After enabling SnapCenter Service, you cannot configure it to run behind Azure firewall. This is an AKS limitation.

== Network requirements
Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your cloud environment.

=== Firewall configuration
If you want to enable SnapCenter Service behind Azure firewall, you should perform the actions.

*Steps*

. Add the below network rules to the firewall.

. Add an application rule in the firewall with the following FQDN tag and port details:
+
* FQDN Tag - AzureKubernetesService
* HTTPS: 443

. Add an Application rule with the below endpoints as target FQDNs with protocol and port as HTTPS:443.

. Select the subnet where you are planning to install SnapCenter Service.
. Create a route table with routes:
+
*	to forward the traffic from the subnet to the firewall internal IP address
*	to forward the traffic from firewall public IP address to the internet.
. Attach the route table to the subnet.

For information on the networking requirements for Cloud Manager Connector, see link:reference_networking_cloud_manager.html[Networking requirements for the Connector].

For information on the outbound rules and FQDNs accessed by the AKS cluster for its regular operation, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/limit-egress-traffic#required-outbound-network-rules-and-fqdns-for-aks-clusters[Required outbound network rules and FQDNs for AKS clusters^].

=== Connectivity to HANA Systems
SnapCenter Service cluster needs to communicate with HANA systems in the userâ€™s network using HDBSQL command. The communication channel between SnapCenter cluster and HANA systems need to be allowed using various network architecture such as:

* Connector and SnapCenter Service cluster deployed in the same VNet as that of HANA systems
* Connector and SnapCenter Service cluster deployed in a different VNet as that of HANA systems, with communication established using VNet peering between the 2 VNets.
* Connector and SnapCenter Service cluster deployed in a different VNet as that of HANA systems, with communication established using VPN gateway between the 2 VNets.


=== Security Group configuration
If network security group (NSG) is configured in the HANA Systems, it should allow inbound communication from SnapCenter port to the port of HANA System as specified in User Store Key.

* Protocol: All TCP
*	Subnet: SnapCenter AKS cluster subnet
*	Purpose: To execute HDBSQL command

The HANA services running in the SnapCenter AKS cluster supports SSL communication with HANA systems which have SSL enabled.

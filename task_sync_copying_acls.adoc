Cloud Sync can copy access control lists (ACLs) between a source SMB share and a target SMB share, or from a source SMB share to object storage (except for ONTAP S3). If needed, you also have the option to manually preserve ACLs between SMB shares by using robocopy.

NOTE: Cloud Sync doesn't support copying ACLs back from object storage to SMB shares.

.Choices

* <<Setting up Cloud Sync to copy ACLs between SMB servers,Set up Cloud Sync to automatically copy ACLs>>
* <<Manually copying ACLs,Manually copy the ACLs between SMB shares>>

== Setting up Cloud Sync to copy ACLs from an SMB server

Copy ACLs from an SMB server by enabling a setting when you create a relationship or after you create a relationship.

.What you'll need

This feature works with _any_ type of data broker: the AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or on-prem data broker. The on-prem data broker can run link:task_sync_installing_linux.html[any supported operating system].

.Steps for a new relationship

. From Cloud Sync, click *Create New Sync*.

. Drag and drop *SMB Server* to the source, choose an SMB server or object storage as the target, and click *Continue*.

. On the *SMB Server* page:
.. Enter a new SMB server or select an existing server and click *Continue*.
.. Enter credentials for the SMB server.
.. Select *Copy Access Control Lists to the target* and click *Continue*.

. Follow the remaining prompts to create the sync relationship.
+
When you copy ACLs from SMB to object storage, you can choose to copy the ACLs to the object's tags or on the object's metadata, depending on the target. For Azure and Google Cloud Storage, only the metadata option is available.
+
The following screenshot shows an example of the step where you can make this choice.

.Steps for an existing relationship

. Hover over the sync relationship and click the action menu.

. Click *Settings*.

. Select *Copy Access Control Lists to the target*.

. Click *Save Settings*.

.Result

When syncing data, Cloud Sync preserves the ACLs between the source and target SMB shares, or from a source SMB share to object storage.

== Manually copying ACLs between SMB shares

You can manually preserve ACLs between SMB shares by using the Windows robocopy command.

.Steps

. Identify a Windows host that has full access to both SMB shares.

. If either of the endpoints require authentication, use the *net use* command to connect to the endpoints from the Windows host.
+
You must perform this step before you use robocopy.

. From Cloud Sync, create a new relationship between the source and target SMB shares or sync an existing relationship.

. After the data sync is complete, run the following command from the Windows host to sync the ACLs and ownership:
+
 robocopy /E /COPY:SOU /secfix [source] [target] /w:0 /r:0 /XD ~snapshots /UNILOG:‚Äù[logfilepath]
+
Both _source_ and _target_ should be specified using the UNC format. For example: \\<server>\<share>\<path>

Respond to a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) by searching for a subject's full name or known identifier (such as an email address) and then downloading a report. The report is designed to aid in your organization's requirement to comply with GDPR or similar data privacy laws.

NOTE: The DSAR capabilities are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not provide file-level details.

NOTE: NetApp can't guarantee 100% accuracy of the personal data and sensitive personal data that Cloud Data Sense identifies. You should always validate the information by reviewing the data.

== What is a Data Subject Access Request?

Privacy regulations such as the European GDPR grant data subjects (such as customers or employees) the right to access their personal data. When a data subject requests this information, this is known as a DSAR (data subject access request). Organizations are required to respond to these requests "without undue delay", and at the latest within one month of receipt.

== How can Cloud Data Sense help you respond to a DSAR?

When you perform a data subject search, Cloud Data Sense finds all of the files, buckets, OneDrive, and SharePoint accounts that have that person's name or identifier in it. Data Sense checks the latest pre-indexed data for the name or identifier. It doesn't initiate a new scan.

After the search is complete, you can then download the list of files for a Data Subject Access Request report. The report aggregates insights from the data and puts it into legal terms that you can send back to the person.

NOTE: Data subject search is not supported within databases at this time.

== Searching for data subjects and downloading reports

Search for the data subject's full name or known identifier and then download a file list report or DSAR report. You can search by link:task_controlling_private_data.html#types-of-personal-data[any personal information type^].

NOTE: English, German, and Spanish are supported when searching for the names of data subjects. Support for more languages will be added later.

. Choose one of the available options:
* *Download DSAR Report*: A formal response to the access request that you can send to the data subject. This report contains automatically-generated information based on data that Cloud Data Sense found on the data subject and is designed to be used as a template. You should complete the form and review it internally before sending it to the data subject.

* *Investigate Results*: A page that enables you to investigate the data by searching, sorting, expanding details for a specific file, and by downloading the file list.
+
NOTE: If there are more than 10,000 results, only the top 10,000 appear in the file list.

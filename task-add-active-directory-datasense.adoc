You can integrate an Active Directory with Cloud Data Sense to enhance the results that Data Sense can report about file owners and which users and groups have access to your files.

This helps in the following locations in Data Sense:

* You can use the "File Owner" filter and see results in the fileâ€™s metadata in the Investigation pane. The file owner SID (Security IDentifier) will include the actual user name.
* You can see link:task_controlling_private_data.html#viewing-permissions-for-files[full file permissions] for each file when you click the "View all Permissions" button.
* In the link:task_controlling_governance_data.html[Governance dashboard], the Open Permissions panel will show a greater level of details about your data.

Note that local user SIDs and SIDs from unknown domains will not be translated to the actual user name.

== Supported data sources

An Active Directory integration with Cloud Data Sense can identify data from the following data sources:

* On-premises ONTAP systems
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP
* Azure NetApp Files
* FSx for ONTAP
* Non-NetApp CIFS file shares (not for NFS file shares)

There is no support currently for identifying this data from Database schemas, OneDrive accounts, Amazon S3 accounts, or Object Storage that uses the Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol.

== Connecting to your Active Directory server

After you have deployed Data Sense and have activated scanning on your data sources, you can integrate the system with your Active Directory.

.Requirements

* You must have an Active Directory already set up for the users in your company.

* You must have the information for the Active Directory:
** DNS Server IP Address
** User Name and Password
** Domain Name (Active Directory Name)
** LDAP Server Port
** Whether you are using secure LDAP (LDAPS)

.Steps

. From the Cloud Data Sense Configuration page, click *Add Active Directory*.

== Managing your Active Directory integration

You can click the *Edit* button to modify any setting in your Active Directory integration.

You can also delete the integration if you no longer need it by clicking the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button and then *Remove Active Directory*.

An Account Admin needs to deploy a _Connector_ before you can use most Cloud Manager features. link:concept_connectors.html[Learn when a Connector is required]. The Connector enables Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

This page describes how to create a Connector in AWS directly from Cloud Manager. You also have the option to link:task_launching_aws_mktp.html[create the Connector from the AWS Marketplace], or to link:task_installing_linux.html[download the software and install it on your own host].

These steps must be completed by a user who has the Account Admin role. A Workspace Admin can't create a Connector.

TIP: When you create your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, Cloud Manager will prompt you to create a Connector if you don't have one yet.

== Setting up AWS permissions to create a Connector

Before you can deploy a Connector from Cloud Manager, you need to ensure that your AWS account has the correct permissions.

.Steps

. Download the Connector IAM policy from the following location:
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[NetApp Cloud Manager: AWS, Azure, and GCP Policies^]
+
TIP: For IAM user permissions for Amazon FSx for ONTAP, see link:task_creating_fsx_working_environment.html[Create an FSx for ONTAP working environment^].

. From the AWS IAM console, create your own policy by copying and pasting the text from the Connector IAM policy.

. Attach the policy that you created in the previous step to the IAM user who will create the Connector from Cloud Manager.



.Result

The AWS user now has the permissions required to create the Connector from Cloud Manager. You'll need to specify AWS access keys for this user when you're prompted by Cloud Manager.

== Creating a Connector in AWS

Cloud Manager enables you to create a Connector in AWS directly from its user interface.

.What you'll need

* An AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[required permissions^] to create a Connector.

* A VPC, subnet, and keypair in your AWS region of choice.

* If you don't want Cloud Manager to automatically create an IAM role for the Connector, then you'll need to create your own https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.8.7.json[using this policy^].
+
These permissions are for the Connector instance. It's a different set of permissions than what's provided in the first bullet above.

.Steps

. If you're creating your first Working Environment, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the prompts. Otherwise, click the *Connector* drop-down and select *Add Connector*.
+

. Choose *Amazon Web Services* as your cloud provider and click *Continue*.
+
Remember that the Connector must have a network connection to the type of working environment that you're creating and the services that you're planning to enable.
+
link:reference_networking_cloud_manager.html[Learn more about networking requirements for the Connector].

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* *Get Ready*: Review what you'll need.

* *AWS Credentials*: Specify the AWS access key and secret key that meet permissions requirements and then select your region.

* *Details*: Enter a name for the instance, specify tags, and choose whether you want Cloud Manager to create a new role that has the required permissions, or if you want to select an existing role that you set up with https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.8.7.json[the required permissions^].

* *Network*: Specify a VPC, subnet, and key pair for the instance, choose whether to enable a public IP address, and optionally specify a proxy configuration.

* *Security Group*: Choose whether to create a new security group or whether to select an existing security group that allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.
+
NOTE: There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the link:concept_connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Click *Add*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

.After you finish

You need to associate a Connector with workspaces so Workspace Admins can use those Connectors to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. If you only have Account Admins, then associating the Connector with workspaces isnâ€™t required. Account Admins have the ability to access all workspaces in Cloud Manager by default. link:task_setting_up_cloud_central_accounts.html#associating-connectors-with-workspaces[Learn more].

Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from your on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon S3 storage.

TIP: In most cases you'll use Cloud Manager for all backup and restore operations. However, starting with ONTAP 9.9.1 you can initiate volume backup operations of your on-premises ONTAP clusters using ONTAP System Manager. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_cloud_backup_data_using_cbs.html[See how to use System Manager to back up your volumes to the cloud using Cloud Backup.^]

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You have discovered the on-premises cluster and added it to a working environment in Cloud Manager. See link:task_discovering_ontap.html[Discovering ONTAP clusters^] for details.
** The cluster is running ONTAP 9.7P5 or later.
** The cluster has a SnapMirror license -- it is included as part of the Premium Bundle or Data Protection Bundle.
** The cluster must have the required network connections to S3 storage and to the Connector.
* The Connector must have the required network connections to S3 storage and to the cluster, and the required permissions.
* You have a valid AWS subscription for the object storage space where your backups will be located.
* You have an AWS Account with an access key and secret key, and the link:task_backup_onprem_to_aws.html#preparing-amazon-s3-for-backups[required permissions] so the ONTAP cluster can back up and restore data.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Define the default backup policy

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. Change to hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly backups, or select one of the system-defined policies that provide more options. You can also change the number of backup copies you want to retain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
By default, backups are stored in S3 Standard storage. If your cluster is using ONTAP 9.10.1 or greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
image:screenshot_backup_policy_aws.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup settings where you can choose the backup schedule and retention period.]

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-6.png[Six] Select the volumes that you want to back up

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Identify which volumes you want to back up using the default backup policy in the Select Volumes page. If you want to assign different backup policies to certain volumes, you can create additional policies and apply them to volumes later.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure you have a supported configuration before you start backing up on-premises volumes to S3 storage.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them:

image:diagram_cloud_backup_onprem_aws.png[A diagram showing how Cloud Backup communicates with the volumes on the source systems and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

Note that when the Cloud Restore instance is deployed in the cloud, it is located in the same subnet as the Connector.

=== Preparing your ONTAP clusters

You need to discover your on-premises ONTAP clusters in Cloud Manager before you can start backing up volume data.

link:task_discovering_ontap.html[Learn how to discover a cluster].

ONTAP requirements::
* ONTAP 9.7P5 and later.
* A SnapMirror license (included as part of the Premium Bundle or Data Protection Bundle).
+
*Note:* The "Hybrid Cloud Bundle" is not required when using Cloud Backup.
+
See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[manage your cluster licenses^].
*	Time and time zone are set correctly.
+
See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-cluster-time-concept.html[configure your cluster time^].

Cluster networking requirements::
* The ONTAP cluster initiates an HTTPS connection over port 443 from the intercluster LIF to Amazon S3 storage for backup and restore operations.
+
ONTAP reads and writes data to and from object storage. The object storage never initiates, it just responds.
+
* ONTAP requires an inbound connection from the Connector to the cluster management LIF. The Connector can reside in an AWS VPC.

* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to back up. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/standard_properties_of_ipspaces.html[Learn more about IPspaces^].
+
When you set up Cloud Backup, you are prompted for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created.
* The nodes' intercluster LIFs are able to access the object store.
*	DNS servers have been configured for the storage VM where the volumes are located. See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/configure_dns_services_auto.html[configure DNS services for the SVM^].
* Note that if you use are using a different IPspace than the Default, then you might need to create a static route to get access to the object storage.
* Update firewall rules, if necessary, to allow Cloud Backup service connections from ONTAP to object storage through port 443 and name resolution traffic from the storage VM to the DNS server over port 53 (TCP/UDP).

=== Creating or switching Connectors

A Connector is required to back up data to the cloud, and the Connector must be in an AWS VPC when backing up data to AWS S3 storage. You can't use a Connector that's deployed on-premises. You'll either need to create a new Connector or make sure that the currently selected Connector resides in the correct provider.

* link:concept_connectors.html[Learn about Connectors]
* link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[Creating a Connector in AWS]
* link:task_managing_connectors.html[Switching between Connectors]

=== Preparing networking for the Connector

Ensure that the Connector has the required networking connections.

.Steps

. Ensure that the network where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:

* An outbound internet connection to the Cloud Backup service over port 443 (HTTPS)
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your S3 object storage
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP clusters

. Enable a VPC Endpoint to S3. This is needed if you have a Direct Connect or VPN connection from your ONTAP cluster to the VPC and you want communication between the Connector and S3 to stay in your AWS internal network.

=== Supported regions

You can create backups from on-premises systems to Amazon S3 in all regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^]. You specify the region where the backups will be stored when you set up the service.

=== License requirements

Before your 30-day free trial of Cloud Backup expires, you need to subscribe to a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) Cloud Manager Marketplace offering from AWS, or purchase and activate a Cloud Backup BYOL license from NetApp. These licenses are for the account and can be used across multiple systems.

* For Cloud Backup PAYGO licensing, you'll need a subscription to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[AWS^] Cloud Manager Marketplace offering to continue using Cloud Backup. Billing for Cloud Backup is done through this subscription.
* For Cloud Backup BYOL licensing, you don't need a subscription. You need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:task_licensing_cloud_backup.html#use-cloud-backup-byol-licenses[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses].

You need to have an AWS subscription for the object storage space where your backups will be located.

A SnapMirror license is required on the cluster. Note that the "Hybrid Cloud Bundle" is not required when using Cloud Backup.

=== Preparing Amazon S3 for backups

When you are using Amazon S3, you must configure permissions for the Connector to create and manage the S3 bucket, and you must configure permissions so the on-premises ONTAP cluster can read and write to the S3 bucket.

.Steps

. Confirm that the following S3 permissions (from the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policy^]) are part of the IAM role that provides the Connector with permissions:
+
[source,json]
{
          "Sid": "backupPolicy",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "s3:DeleteBucket",
              "s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration",
              "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration",
              "s3:PutBucketTagging",
              "s3:ListBucketVersions",
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:ListBucket",
              "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
              "s3:GetBucketTagging",
              "s3:GetBucketLocation",
              "s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus",
              "s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",
              "s3:GetBucketAcl",
              "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
              "s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock"
          ],
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::netapp-backup-*"
          ]
      },

. Add the following EC2 permissions to the IAM role that provides the Connector with permissions so that it can start, stop, and terminate the Cloud Restore instance:
+
[source,json]
          "Action": [
              "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
              "ec2:StartInstances",
              "ec2:StopInstances",
              "ec2:TerminateInstances"
          ],

. During the Backup wizard you will be prompted to enter an access key and secret key. For that, you will need to create an IAM user with the following permissions. Cloud Backup passes these credentials on to the ONTAP cluster so that ONTAP can backup and restore data to the S3 bucket.
+
[source,json]
"s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
"s3:ListBucket",
"s3:GetBucketLocation",
"s3:GetObject",
"s3:PutObject",
"s3:PutBucketencryption",
"s3:DeleteObject"
+
See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html[AWS Documentation: Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User^] for details.

. If your virtual or physical network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the Cloud Restore instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints.

. You can choose your own custom-managed keys for data encryption in the activation wizard instead of using the default Amazon S3 encryption keys. In this case you'll need to have the encryption managed keys already set up. link:task_setting_up_kms.html[See how to use your own keys].

. If you want to have a more secure connection over the public internet from your on-prem data center to the VPC, there is an option to select an AWS PrivateLink connection in the activation wizard. It is required if you are connecting your on-premises system via VPN/DirectConnect. In this case you'll need to have created an Interface endpoint configuration using the Amazon VPC console or the command line. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html[See details about using AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3^].
+
Note that you'll also need to modify the security group configuration that is associated with the Cloud Manager Connector. You must change the policy to "Custom" (from "Full Access"), and you must add the permissions from the backup policy as shown earlier (above).
+

== Enabling Cloud Backup

Enable Cloud Backup at any time directly from the on-premises working environment.

.Steps

. From the Canvas, select the working environment and click *Enable* next to the Backup & Restore service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_cvo_enable.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup & Restore Enable button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. Select Amazon Web Services as your provider and click *Next*.

. Enter the provider details and click *Next*.

.. The AWS Account, the AWS Access Key, and the Secret Key used to store the backups.
+
The access key and secret key are for the user you created to give the ONTAP cluster access to the S3 bucket.
.. The AWS region where the backups will be stored.
.. Whether you'll use the default Amazon S3 encryption keys or choose your own customer-managed keys from your AWS account to manage encryption of your data. (link:task_setting_up_kms.html[See how to use your own keys]).
+
image:screenshot_backup_provider_settings_aws.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from an ONTAP system to AWS S3.]

. Enter the networking details and click *Next*.

.. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access.
.. Optionally, choose whether you'll use an AWS PrivateLink that you have previously configured. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html[See details about using AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3^].
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_aws_networking.png[A screenshot that shows the networking details when backing up volumes from an ONTAP system to AWS S3.]

. Enter the default backup policy details and click *Next*.

.. Define the backup schedule and choose the number of backups to retain. link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html#customizable-backup-schedule-and-retention-settings-per-cluster[See the list of existing policies you can choose^].
.. When using ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:reference-aws-backup-tiers.html[Learn more about using archival tiers].
+
image:screenshot_backup_policy_aws.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup settings where you can choose your schedule and backup retention.]

. Select the volumes that you want to back up using the default backup policy in the Select Volumes page. If you want to assign different backup policies to certain volumes, you can create additional policies and apply them to those volumes later.

+
* To back up all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).
+
image:screenshot_backup_select_volumes.png[A screenshot of selecting the volumes that will be backed up.]

+
If you want all volumes added in the future to have backup enabled, just leave the checkbox for "Automatically back up future volumes..." checked. If you disable this setting, you'll need to manually enable backups for future volumes.

. Click *Activate Backup* and Cloud Backup starts taking the initial backups of your volumes.

.Result

Cloud Backup starts taking the initial backups of each selected volume and the Volume Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups.

.What's next?

You can link:task_managing_backups.html[start and stop backups for volumes or change the backup schedule^].
You can also link:task_restore_backups.html[restore entire volumes or individual files from a backup file^] to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in AWS, or to an on-premises ONTAP system.

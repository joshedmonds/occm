[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the schemas that you want to scan.

== Reviewing prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Data Sense.

=== Supported databases

Cloud Data Sense can scan schemas from the following databases:

* Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SAP HANA
* SQL Server (MSSQL)

CAUTION: The statistics gathering feature *must be enabled* in the database.

=== Database requirements

Any database with connectivity to the Cloud Data Sense instance can be scanned, regardless of where it is hosted. You just need the following information to connect to the database:

* IP Address or host name
* Port
* Service name (only for accessing Oracle databases)
* Credentials that allow read access to the schemas
+
When choosing a user name and password, it’s important to choose one that has full read permissions to all the schemas and tables you want to scan. We recommend that you create a dedicated user for the Cloud Data Sense system with all the required permissions.

*Note:* For MongoDB, a read-only Admin role is required.

== Deploying the Cloud Data Sense instance

Deploy Cloud Data Sense if there isn't already an instance deployed.

Data Sense can be link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

Upgrades to Data Sense software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

== Adding the database server

You must have link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed an instance of Cloud Data Sense in Cloud Manager already^].

Add the database server where the schemas reside.

. From the Working Environments Configuration page, click *Add Data Source* > *Add Database Server*.

. Enter the required information to identify the database server.
.. Select the database type.
.. Enter the port and the host name or IP address to connect to the database.
.. For Oracle databases, enter the Service name.
.. Enter the credentials so that Cloud Data Sense can access the server.
.. Click *Add DB Server*.
+

The database is added to the list of working environments.

== Enabling and disabling compliance scans on database schemas

You can stop or start full scanning of your schemas at any time.

TIP: There is no option to select mapping-only scans for database schemas.

. From the _Configuration_ page, click the *Configuration* button for the database you want to configure.
+

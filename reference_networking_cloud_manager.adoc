Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, you can specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Configuring the Connector to use a proxy server].

== Connection to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the type of working environment that you’re creating and the services that you’re planning to enable.

For example, if you install a Connector in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the VPC or VNet in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Possible conflict with IP addresses in the 172 range

If your network has a subnet configured in the 172 range, then you might experience connectivity failures from Cloud Manager. link:reference_issues.html[Learn more about this known issue].

== Outbound internet access

The Connector requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. Outbound internet access is also required if you want to manually install the Connector on a Linux host or access the local UI running on the Connector.

The following sections identify the specific endpoints.

=== Endpoints to manage resources in AWS

A Connector contacts the following endpoints when managing resources in AWS:

NOTE: If your VPC uses a network access control list (ACL) to filter traffic, then make sure that you enable these endpoints for both outbound and inbound traffic.

=== Endpoints to manage resources in Azure

A Connector contacts the following endpoints when managing resources in Azure:

include::_include/connector_endpoints_azure.adoc[]

=== Endpoints to manage resources in GCP

A Connector contacts the following endpoints when managing resources in GCP:

include::_include/connector_endpoints_gcp.adoc[]

=== Endpoints to install the Connector on a Linux host

You have the option to manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host. If you do, the installer for the Connector must access the following URLs during the installation process:

* \http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
* \https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
* \https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip
* *.blob.core.windows.net

The host might try to update operating system packages during installation. The host can contact different mirroring sites for these OS packages.

=== Endpoints accessed from your web browser when using the local UI

While you should perform almost all tasks from the SaaS user interface, a local user interface is still available on the Connector. The machine running the web browser must have connections to the following endpoints:

| Purpose
|
The Connector host

a| You must enter the host's IP address from a web browser to load the Cloud Manager console.

Depending on your connectivity to your cloud provider, you can use the private IP or a public IP assigned to the host:

- A private IP works if you have a VPN and direct connect access to your virtual network
- A public IP works in any networking scenario

In any case, you should secure network access by ensuring that security group rules allow access from only authorized IPs or subnets.

| Your web browser connects to these endpoints for centralized user authentication through NetApp Cloud Central.

== Ports and security groups

There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the link:concept_connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

=== Rules for the Connector in AWS

The security group for the Connector requires both inbound and outbound rules.

==== Inbound rules

[cols="10,10,80",width=100%,options="header"]
|===

| Protocol
| Port
| Purpose

| SSH | 22 | Provides SSH access to the Connector host
| HTTP | 80 |	Provides HTTP access from client web browsers to the local user interface and connections from Cloud Data Sense
| HTTPS |	443 |	Provides HTTPS access from client web browsers to the local user interface
| TCP | 3128 | Provides the Cloud Data Sense instance with internet access, if your AWS network doesn’t use a NAT or proxy

|===

==== Outbound rules

The predefined security group for the Connector opens all outbound traffic. If that is acceptable, follow the basic outbound rules. If you need more rigid rules, use the advanced outbound rules.

===== Basic outbound rules

The predefined security group for the Connector includes the following outbound rules.

[cols=3*,options="header",width=70%,cols="20,20,60"]
|===

| Protocol
| Port
| Purpose

| All TCP | All | All outbound traffic
| All UDP | All |	All outbound traffic

|===

===== Advanced outbound rules

If you need rigid rules for outbound traffic, you can use the following information to open only those ports that are required for outbound communication by the Connector.

NOTE: The source IP address is the Connector host.

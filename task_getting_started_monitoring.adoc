Complete a few steps to start monitoring Cloud Volumes ONTAP performance.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You need a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system running in AWS or Azure.
* For AWS, you need a Connector running version 3.8.4 or later.
* For Azure, you need a Connector running version 3.9.3 or later.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Enable Monitoring on your new or existing system

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* New working environments: Be sure to keep Monitoring enabled when you create the working environment (itâ€™s enabled by default).

* Existing working environments: Select a working environment and click *Start Monitoring*.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Click *Monitoring* and view performance data for your volumes.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration.

Supported Cloud Volumes ONTAP versions::
Any version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS or in Azure.

Supported Connector::
* For AWS, you need a Connector running version 3.8.4 or later.
* For Azure, you need a Connector running version 3.9.3 or later.

TIP: You can view a Connector's version by clicking the image:screenshot_help_icon.gif[A screenshot of the help icon in the top right of Cloud Manager] icon and then *Support > Connector*.

Email address for Cloud Central::
The email address for your Cloud Central user account should be your business email address. Free email domains like gmail and hotmail aren't supported when creating a Cloud Insights tenant.

Networking for the Acquisition Unit::
The Acquisition Unit uses 2-way/mutual authentication to connect to the Cloud Insights server. The client certificate must be passed to the Cloud Insights server to be authenticated. To accomplish this, the proxy must be set up to forward the http request to the Cloud Insights server without decrypting the data.
+
The Acquisition Unit uses the following two endpoints to communicate with Cloud Insights. If you have a firewall between the Acquisition Unit server and Cloud Insights, you need these endpoints when configuring firewall rules:
+
 https://aulogin.<Cloud Insights Domain>
 https://<your-tenant-ID>.<Cloud Insights Domain>
+
For example:

 https://aulogin.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
 https://cg0c586a-ee05-45rb-a5ac-333b5ae7718d7.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
+
Contact us through the in-product chat if you need help identifying your Cloud Insights domain and tenant ID.

Networking for the Connector::
Similar to the Acquisition Unit, the Connector must have outbound connectivity to the Cloud Insights tenant. But the endpoint that the Connector contacts is slightly different. It contacts the tenant host URL using the shortened tenant ID:
+
 https://<your-short-tenant-ID>.<Cloud Insights Domain>
+
For example:
+
 https://abcd12345.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
+
Again, you can contact us through the in-product chat if you need help identifying the tenant host URL.

== Enabling monitoring on a new system

The Monitoring service is enabled by default in the working environment wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

.Steps

. Click *Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Select Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure as the cloud provider and then choose a single node or HA system.

. Fill out the Details & Credentials page.

. On the Services page, leave the Monitoring service enabled and click *Continue*.

== Enabling monitoring on an existing system

Enable monitoring at any time from the working environment.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Canvas*.

. Select a working environment.

. In the pane on the right, click *Start Monitoring*.
+

== Monitoring your volumes

Monitor performance by viewing IOPS, throughput, and latency for each of your volumes.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Monitoring*.

. Filter the contents of the dashboard to get the information that you need.
+
* Select a specific working environment.
* Select a different timeframe.
* Select a specific SVM.
* Search for a specific volume.
+
The following image highlights each of these options:
+

. Click a volume in the table to expand the row and view a timeline for IOPS, throughput, and latency.
+

. Use the data to identify performance issues to minimize impact on your users and apps.

== Getting more information from Cloud Insights

The Monitoring tab in Cloud Manager provides basic performance data for your volumes. You can go to the Cloud Insights web interface from your browser to perform more in-depth monitoring and to configure alerts for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Monitoring*.

. Click the *Cloud Insights* link.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_insights.gif[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Insights link that is available in the top right of the Monitoring tab.]

.Result

Cloud Insights open in a new browser tab. If you need help, refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights[Cloud Insights documentation^].

== Disabling monitoring

If you no longer want to monitor Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can disable the service at any time.

NOTE: If you disable monitoring from each of your working environments, you'll need to delete the virtual machine instance yourself. The instance is named _AcquisitionUnit_ with a generated hash (UUID) concatenated to it. For example: _AcquisitionUnit-FAN7FqeH_

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Canvas*.

. Select a working environment.

. In the pane on the right, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[A screenshot of the options icon that appears in the Services pane after selecting a working environment] icon and select *Deactivate Scan*.

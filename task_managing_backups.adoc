[.lead]
You can manage backups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems by changing the backup schedule, enabling/disabling volume backups, creating an on-demand backup, deleting backups, and more.

CAUTION: Do not manage or change backup files directly from your cloud provider environment. This may corrupt the files and will result in an unsupported configuration.

== Viewing the volumes that are being backed up

You can view a list of all the volumes that are currently being backed up in the Backup Dashboard.

.Steps

. Click the *Backup & Restore* tab.

. Click the *Backup* tab and the Backup Dashboard is displayed.

If you are looking for specific volumes in certain working environments, you can refine the list by working environment and volume, or you can use the search filter.

== Changing the schedule and backup retention

The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. You can change to a combination of hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly backups and you can change the number of backup copies to retain. You can also select one of the system-defined policies that provide scheduled backups for 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years.

Changing the backup policy affects both new volumes created after you change the schedule, and any existing volumes that were using the original policy.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment where you want to change the settings and select *Modify Policy*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_modify_policy.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. From the _Modify Policy_ page, change the schedule and backup retention and then click *Save*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_modify_policy_page.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup settings where you can modify the backup schedule and backup retention setting.]

== Starting and stopping backups of volumes

You can stop backing up a volume if you do not need backup copies of that volume and you do not want to pay for the cost to store the backups. You can also add a new volume to the backup list if it is not currently being backed up.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_settings_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment and select *Manage Volumes*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_manage_volumes.png[A screenshot that shows the Manage Volumes button from the Backup Settings page.]

. Select the checkbox for volumes that you want to start backing up, and deselect the checkbox for volumes that you want to stop backing up.
+
image:screenshot_backup_manage_volumes_page.png[The Manage Volumes page where you can select or deselect volumes.]

. Click *Save* to commit your changes.

*Note:* When stopping a volume from being backed up you’ll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that the backups use unless you <<Deleting backups,delete the backups>>.

== Creating a manual volume backup at any time

You can create an on-demand backup at any time to capture the current state of the volume. This can be useful if very important changes have been made to a volume and you don't want to wait for the next scheduled backup to protect that data, or if the volume is not currently being backed up and you want to capture its current state.

The backup name includes the timestamp so you can identify your on-demand backup from other scheduled backups.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the volume and select *Backup Now*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_now_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Now button which is available after you select a volume.]

The Backup Status column for that volume displays "In Progress" until the backup is created.

== Viewing the list of backups for each volume

You can view the list of all backup files that exist for each volume. This page displays details about the source volume, destination location, and backup details such as last backup taken, the current backup policy, backup file size, and more.

This page also enables you perform the following tasks:

* Delete all backup files for the volume
* Delete individual backup files for the volume
* Download a backup report for the volume

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the source volume and select *Details & Backup List*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_view_backups_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Details & Backup List button which is available for a single volume.]
+
The list of all backup files is displayed along with details about the source volume, destination location, and backup details.
+
image:screenshot_backup_view_backups.png[A screenshot that shows the List of all backup files for a single volume.]

== Deleting backups

Cloud Backup enables you to delete a single backup file, delete all backups for a volume, or delete all backups of all volumes in a working environment. You might want to delete all backups if you no longer need the backups or if you deleted the source volume and want to remove all backups.

Note that deleting all backups does not disable further backups of this volume or the working environment. If you want to stop creating backups of a volume, you can disable backups <<Starting and stopping backups of volumes,as described here>>. If you want to stop creating backups of all volumes in a working environment, you can deactivate backups <<Disabling Cloud Backup for a working environment,as described here>>.

CAUTION: If you plan to delete a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system that has backups, you must delete the backups *before* deleting the system. Cloud Backup doesn’t automatically delete backups when you delete a system, and there is no current support in the UI to delete the backups after the system has been deleted. You'll continue to be charged for object storage costs for any remaining backups.

== Disabling Cloud Backup for a working environment

Disabling Cloud Backup for a working environment disables backups of each volume on the system, and it also disables the ability to restore a volume. Any existing backups will not be deleted. This does not unregister the backup service from this working environment - it basically allows you to pause all backup and restore activity for a period of time.

Note that you'll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that your backups use unless you <<Deleting all backup files for a working environment,delete the backups>>.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_settings_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment where you want to disable backups and select *Deactivate Backup*.
+
image:screenshot_disable_backups.png[A screenshot of the Deactivate Backup button for a working environment.]

. In the confirmation dialog box, click *Deactivate*.

NOTE: An *Activate Backup* button appears for that working environment while backup is disabled. You can click this button when you want to re-enable backup functionality for that working environment.

== Unregistering Cloud Backup for a working environment

You can unregister Cloud Backup for a working environment if you no longer want to use backup functionality and you want to stop being charged for backups in that working environment. Typically this feature is used when you're planning to delete a working environment and you want to cancel the backup service.

Before you can unregister Cloud Backup, you must perform the following steps, in this order:

* Deactivate Cloud Backup for the working environment
* Delete all backups for that working environment

The unregister option is not available until these two actions are complete.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_settings_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment where you want to unregister the backup service and select *Unregister*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_unregister.png[A screenshot of the Unregister backup button for a working environment.]

The Monitoring service gives you insights into the health and performance of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances and helps you troubleshoot and optimize the performance of your cloud storage environment.

== Features

* Automatically monitor all volumes
* View volume performance data in terms of IOPS, throughput, and latency
* Identify performance issues to minimize impact on your users and apps

== Supported cloud providers

The Monitoring service is supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for AWS and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Azure.

== Cost

NetApp doesn't charge you for using the Monitoring service, but Cloud Manager launches a virtual machine in your VPC to facilitate monitoring. This VM results in charges from your cloud provider.

== How the Monitoring service works

Cloud Manager leverages https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-insights[NetApp's Cloud Insights service] to provide monitoring.

At a high-level, Cloud Insights integration with Cloud Manager works like this:

. You enable the Monitoring service on Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
. Cloud Manager configures your environment. It does the following:
.. Creates a Cloud Insights tenant (also called _environment_) and associates all users in your Cloud Central account to the tenant.
+
If you already have a tenant, then Cloud Manager uses that existing tenant.
.. Enables a free trial of Cloud Insights.
+
On the 29th day, your plan automatically transitions from the Trial Version to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#editions[Basic Edition^].
.. Deploys a virtual machine in your VPC/VNet called an Acquisition Unit. The Acquisition Unit facilitates monitoring of volumes (this is the VM mentioned in the Cost section above).
.. Connects the Acquisition Unit to Cloud Volumes ONTAP and to the Cloud Insights tenant.
. In Cloud Manager, you click Monitoring and use the performance data to troubleshoot and optimize performance.

The following image shows the relationship between these components in an AWS VPC:

=== The Acquisition Unit

When you enable Monitoring, Cloud Manager deploys an Acquisition Unit in the same subnet as the Connector.

An _Acquisition Unit_ collects performance data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP and sends it to the Cloud Insights tenant. Cloud Manager then queries that data and presents it to you.

Note the following about the Acquisition Unit instance:

* In AWS, the Acquisition Unit runs on a t3.xlarge instance with a 100 GiB GP2 volume.
* In Azure, the Acquisition Unit runs on a D4_v3 virtual machine with a 30 GiB Standard SSD.
* The instance is named _CloudInsights-AU_ with a generated hash (UUID) concatenated to it. For example: _CloudInsights-AU-FAN7FqeH_
* Only one Acquisition Unit is deployed per Connector.
* The instance must be running to access performance information in the Monitoring tab.

=== Cloud Insights tenant

If you don't already have a _tenant_, Cloud Manager sets one up for you when you enable Monitoring. A Cloud Insights tenant enables you to access the performance data that the Acquisition Unit collects. The tenant is a secure data partition within the NetApp Cloud Insights service.

=== Cloud Insights web interface

The Monitoring tab in Cloud Manager provides basic performance data for your volumes. You can go to the Cloud Insights web interface from your browser to perform more in-depth monitoring and to configure alerts for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

=== Free trial and subscription

Cloud Manager enables a free trial of Cloud Insights to provide performance data within Cloud Manager and for you to explore the features that Cloud Insights Standard Edition has to offer.

On the 29th day, your plan automatically transitions from the Trial Version to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#editions[Basic Edition^].

You have the option to subscribe to the Standard or Premium editions to gain access to additional features from the Cloud Insights web interface.

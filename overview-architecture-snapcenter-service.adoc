SnapCenter Service provides data protection capabilities for applications running on NetApp® Cloud Storage. SnapCenter Service enabled within NetApp Cloud Manager offers efficient, application consistent, policy-based backup and restore of SAP HANA® Systems residing on Azure NetApp Files (ANF).

The architecture of SnapCenter Service include the following components.

* SnapCenter Service UI is integrated with Cloud Manager UI.
+
The SnapCenter UI is served from the Cloud Manager SAAS framework managed by NetApp that offers multiple storage and data management capabilities.
* Cloud Manager Connector is a component from Cloud Manager that manages the life cycle of the SnapCenter and several other services.
* SnapCenter Service is a set of data protection services hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) that orchestrates the data protection workflows.

The following diagram shows the relationship between each component of SnapCenter Service:

The SnapCenter Service UI communicates with the Cloud Manager Connector for user-initiated request. The Connector then communicates to SnapCenter Service and SnapCenter Service invokes ANF management APIs and HANA system commands to perform data protection operations.

SnapCenter Service can be deployed in the same VNet as that of the HANA system, or in a different one. If SnapCenter Service and HANA systems are on different network, network connectivity  is required between them.

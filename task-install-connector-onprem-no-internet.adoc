You can install the Connector on an on-premises Linux host that doesn't have internet access. You can then discover on-prem ONTAP clusters, replicate data between them, and scan them with Cloud Data Sense.

These installation instructions are specifically for the use case described above. link:concept_connectors.html#how-to-create-a-connector[Learn about other ways to deploy a Connector].

== Verify host requirements

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on.

A dedicated host is required::
The Connector is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.

Disk type:: An SSD is required

Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available

Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available

Docker Engine:: Docker Engine version 19 or later is required on the host before you install the Connector. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^].

== Install the Connector

After you verify that you have a supported Linux host, you can obtain the Connector software and then install it.

.Required privileges

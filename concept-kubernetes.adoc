[.lead]
Add managed-Kubernetes clusters to Cloud Manager for advanced data management.

== Features

* Add managed-Kubernetes clusters to the Canvas
* Back up persistent volumes using Cloud Backup Service

== Supported Kubernetes deployments

Cloud Manager supports managed-Kubernetes clusters running in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).

== Supported backend storage

NetApp's Astra Trident must be installed on each EKS cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be configured as backend storage for the clusters.

== Cost

There are no charges to _discover_ your Kubernetes clusters in Cloud Manager, but you will be charged when you back up persistent volumes using Cloud Backup Service.

* Back up persistent volumes using Cloud Backup Service

== Supported Kubernetes deployments

Cloud Manager supports managed-Kubernetes clusters running in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

== Supported backend storage

NetApp's Astra Trident must be installed on each Kubernetes cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be configured as backend storage for the clusters.

== Cost

There are no charges to _discover_ your Kubernetes clusters in Cloud Manager, but you will be charged when you back up persistent volumes using Cloud Backup Service.

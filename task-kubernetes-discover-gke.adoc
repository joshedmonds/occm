You can discover a fully-managed or self-managed Kubernetes cluster. Managed clusters must be discovered; they cannot be imported.

.Steps

. On the *Canvas*, click *Add Working Environment*.

. Select *Google Cloud Platform* > *Kubernetes Cluster* and click *Next*.

== Import a Cluster
You can import a self-managed Kubernetes cluster using a Kubernetes configuration file.

== Before you get started
You will need Certificate Authority, Client Key, and Client Certificate certificates for the user specified in the cluster role YAML file to import Kubernetes clusters. The Kubernetes cluster administrator receives these certifications when creating users on the Kubernetes cluster.

.Steps

. On the *Canvas*, click *Add Working Environment*.

. Select *Google Cloud Platform* > *Kubernetes Cluster* and click *Next*.

. Select *Import Cluster* and click *Next*.

. Upload a Kubernetes configuration file in YAML format.

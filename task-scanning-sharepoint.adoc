Ensure that you have the Admin credentials to log into the SharePoint account, and that you have the URLs for the SharePoint sites that you want to scan.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Log into the SharePoint account

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Using Admin user credentials, log into the SharePoint account that you want to access so that it is added as a new data source/working environment.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Add the SharePoint site URLs to scan

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add the list of SharePoint site URLs that you want to scan in the SharePoint account, and select the type of scanning. You can add up to 100 URLs at time.

== Reviewing SharePoint requirements

Review the following prerequisites to make sure you are ready to enable Cloud Data Sense on a SharePoint account.

* You must have the Admin login credentials for the SharePoint account that provides read access to all SharePoint sites.
* You will need a line-separated list of the SharePoint site URLs for all the data you want to scan.

== Deploying the Cloud Data Sense instance

Deploy Cloud Data Sense if there isn't already an instance deployed.

Data Sense can be link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

Upgrades to Data Sense software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

Data Sense can also be link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deployed in an on-premises location that has no internet access^]. However, you'll need to provide internet access to a few select endpoints to scan SharePoint files. link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html#sharepoint-and-onedrive-special-requirements[See the list of required endpoints here].

== Adding the SharePoint account

Add the SharePoint account where the user files reside.

.Steps

. From the Working Environments Configuration page, click *Add Data Source* > *Add SharePoint Online Account*.

. In the Add a SharePoint Online Account dialog, click *Sign in to SharePoint*.

. In the Microsoft page that appears, select the SharePoint account and enter the required Admin user and password, then click *Accept* to allow Cloud Data Sense to read data from this account.

The SharePoint account is added to the list of working environments.

== Adding SharePoint sites to compliance scans

You can add individual SharePoint sites, or all of the SharePoint sites in the account, so that the associated files will be scanned by Cloud Data Sense.

.Steps

. From the _Configuration_ page, click the *Configuration* button for the SharePoint account.
+

. If this is the first time adding sites for this SharePoint account, click *Add your first SharePoint site*.
+

+
If you are adding additional users from a SharePoint account, click *Add SharePoint Sites*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_sharepoint_add_more_sites.png[A screenshot showing the Add SharePoint sites button to add more sites to an account.]

. Add the URLs for the sites whose files you want to scan - one URL per line (up to 100 maximum per session) - and click *Add Sites*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_sharepoint_add_site.png[A screenshot of the Add SharePoint Sites page where you can add sites to be scanned.]
+
A confirmation dialog displays the number of sites that were added.
+
If the dialog lists any sites that could not be added, capture this information so that you can resolve the issue. In some cases you can re-add the site with a corrected URL.

. Enable mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, on the files in the SharePoint sites.

| Enable full scans on files | Click *Map & Classify*
| Disable scanning on files | Click *Off*

.Result

Cloud Data Sense starts scanning the files in the SharePoint sites you added, and the results are displayed in the Dashboard and in other locations.

== Removing a SharePoint site from compliance scans

If you remove a SharePoint site in the future, or decide not to scan files in a SharePoint site, you can remove individual SharePoint sites from having their files scanned at any time. Just click *Remove SharePoint Site* from the Configuration page.

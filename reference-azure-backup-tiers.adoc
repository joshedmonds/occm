Cloud Backup supports one Azure archival access tier and most regions.

== Supported Azure Blob access tiers

When backup files are initially created they are stored in the _Cool_ access tier.

If your clusters are running ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups from _Cool_ to _Azure Archive_ storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization.

When you configure Cloud Backup with these lifecycle rules, you must not configure any lifecycle rules when setting up the container in your Azure account.

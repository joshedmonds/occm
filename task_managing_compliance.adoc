If you need to, you can stop Cloud Data Sense from scanning one or more working environments, databases, file share groups, OneDrive accounts, or SharePoint accounts. You can also delete the Cloud Data Sense instance if you no longer want to use Data Sense with your working environments.

== Deactivating compliance scans for a working environment

When you deactivate scans, Cloud Data Sense no longer scans the data on the working environment and it removes the indexed compliance insights from the Data Sense instance (the data from the working environment itself isn't deleted).

. From the _Configuration_ page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button in the row for the working environment, and then click *Deactivate Data Sense*.

TIP: You can also disable compliance scans for a working environment from the Services panel when you select the working environment.

== Removing a database from Cloud Data Sense

If you no longer want to scan a certain database, you can delete it from the Cloud Data Sense interface and stop all scans.

. From the _Configuration_ page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button in the row for the database, and then click *Remove DB Server*.

== Reducing the Data Sense scan speed

Data scans have a negligible impact on your storage systems and on your data. However, if you are concerned with even a very small impact, you can configure Data Sense to perform "slow" scans. When enabled, slow scanning is used on all data sources - you can't configure slow scanning for a single working environment or data source.

TIP: The scan speed can't be reduced when scanning databases.

.Steps

. From the bottom of the _Configuration_ page, move the slider to the right to activate slow scanning.

The top of the Configuration page indicates that slow scanning is enabled.

. You can disable slow scanning by clicking *Disable* from this message.

== Deleting the Cloud Data Sense instance

You can delete the Cloud Data Sense instance if you no longer want to use Data Sense. Deleting the instance also deletes the associated disks where the indexed data resides.

. Go to your cloud provider's console and delete the Cloud Data Sense instance.
+
The instance is named _CloudCompliance_ with a generated hash (UUID) concatenated to it. For example: _CloudCompliance-16bb6564-38ad-4080-9a92-36f5fd2f71c7_

[role="quick-margin-para"]
See link:task_deploy_gfc_edge_instances.html[Deploying Global File Cache Edge instances^] to deploy the Global File Cache Edge instances in each remote location. This step is not done using Cloud Manager.

=== Deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP as your storage platform

In the current release, Global File Cache supports Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployed in Azure or AWS.  For detailed prerequisites, requirements, and deployment instructions, see link:task_deploying_otc_azure.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure^] or link:task_deploying_otc_aws.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS^].

Note the following additional Global File Cache requirement:

* You should configure SMB file shares on the instance of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
If no SMB file shares are set up on the instance, then you are prompted to configure the SMB shares during the installation of the Global File Cache components.

=== Enable Global File Cache in your working environment

The Global File Cache wizard walks you through the steps to deploy the Global File Cache Management Server instance and the Global File Cache Core instance, as highlighted below.

. After the Global File Cache Management Service is successfully deployed, click *Continue*.

. For the Global File Cache Core, enter the admin user credentials to join the Active Directory domain, and the service account user credentials. Then click *Continue*.
+
* The Global File Cache Core instance must be deployed in the same Active Directory domain as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.
* The service account is a domain user and it is part of the BUILTIN\Backup Operators group on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_install6.png[A screenshot showing the configuration information necessary to set up the Global File Cache Core active directory and service account.]

. Enter the admin credentials you will use to access to the Global File Cache Core VM and click *Deploy GFC Core*. For Azure you enter the credentials as a user name and password; for AWS you select the appropriate key pair. You can change the VM/instance name if you want.
+

The Dashboard shows that the Management Server instance and the Core instance are both *On* and working.

=== License your Global File Cache installation

Before you can use Global File Cache, you need to configure the Global File Cache License Management Server (LMS) service on a Global File Cache Core instance. You will need your NSS Credentials or a Customer ID and Subscription Number provided NetApp to activate your subscription.

In this example, we will configure the LMS service on a Core instance that you just deployed in the public cloud. This is a one-time process that sets up your LMS service.

.Steps

. Open the Global File Cache License Registration page on the Global File Cache Core (the Core you are designating as your LMS service) using the following URL. Replace _<ip_address>_ with the IP address of the Global File Cache Core:
https://<ip_address>/lms/api/v1/config/lmsconfig.html

. Click *“Continue to this website (not recommended)”* to continue. A page that allows you to configure the LMS, or check existing license information, is displayed.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license1.png[A screenshot of the Global File Cache License Registration page.]

. Choose the mode of registration:
* “NetApp LMS” is used for customers who have purchased NetApp Global File Cache Edge licenses from NetApp or its certified partners. (Preferred)
* “Legacy LMS” is used for existing or trial customers who have received a Customer ID through NetApp Support. (This option has been deprecated.)
//
// . For Legacy MS, click *Legacy MS*, enter your NSS Credentials, and click *Submit*.
// +
// image:screenshot_gfc_license3.png[A screenshot of entering a Legacy MS NSS Credentials in the Global File Cache License Registration page.]

. For this example, click *NetApp LMS*, enter your Customer ID (preferably your email address), and click *Register LMS*.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license2.png[A screenshot of entering an On-Premise LMS Customer ID in the Global File Cache License Registration page.]

. Check for a confirmation email from NetApp that includes your GFC Software Subscription Number and Serial Number.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license_email.png[A screenshot of the email from NetApp that contains your GFC Software Subscription Number.]

. Click the *NetApp LMS Settings* tab.

. Select *GFC License Subscription*, enter your GFC Software Subscription Number, and click *Submit*.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license_subscription.png[A screenshot of entering your GFC Software Subscription Number in the GFC License Subscription page.]
+
You will see a message that your GFC License Subscription was registered successfully and activated for the LMS instance. Any subsequent purchases will automatically be added to the GFC License Subscription.

. Optionally, you can click the *License Information* tab to view all your GFC license information.

.What’s Next?

If you have determined that you need to deploy multiple Global File Cache Cores to support your configuration, click *Add Core Instance* from the Dashboard and follow the deployment wizard.

After you have completed your Core deployment, you need to link:download_gfc_resources.html[deploy the Global File Cache Edge instances^] in each of your remote offices.

== Deploy additional Core instances

If your configuration requires more than one Global File Cache Core to be installed because of a large number of Edge instances, you can add another Core to the working environment.

When deploying Edge instances, you will configure some to connect to the first Core and others to the second Core. Both Core instances access the same backend storage (your Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance) in the working environment.

. From the Global File Cache Dashboard, click *Add Core Instance*.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_add_another_core.png[A screenshot of the GFC Dashboard and the button to add an additional Core instance.]

. Enter the admin user credentials to join the Active Directory domain, and the service account user credentials. Then click *Continue*.
+
* The Global File Cache Core instance must be in the same Active Directory domain as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.
* The service account is a domain user and it is part of the BUILTIN\Backup Operators group on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_install6.png[A screenshot showing the configuration information necessary to set up the Global File Cache Core active directory and service account.]

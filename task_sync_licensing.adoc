= Paying for sync relationships after your free trial ends

There are two ways to pay for sync relationships after your 14-day free trial ends. The first option is to subscribe from AWS or Azure to pay-as-you-go or to pay annually. The second option is to purchase licenses directly from NetApp.

You can subscribe from either the AWS Marketplace or the Azure Marketplace. You can't subscribe from both.

You have the option to use licenses from NetApp with a Marketplace subscription. For example, if you have 25 sync relationships, you can pay for the first 20 sync relationships using a license and then pay-as-you-go from AWS or Azure with the remaining 5 sync relationships.

You won't be able to create any additional relationships. Existing relationships are not deleted, but you cannot make any changes to them until you subscribe or enter a license.

After enabling the SnapCenter Service, install the HDBSQL client to perform data protection operations on SAP HANA databases. The HDBSQL client is used to communicate with the SAP HANA systems.

*Steps*

. Download HDB Client software from your SAP account.
+
It is an archive file with (.SAR) extension. Example: IMDB_CLIENT20_008_20-80002082.SAR
+
NOTE: The HDB Client software version should be 2.4.202.1590784230 or later.

. Download the latest SAPCAR utility from your SAP account. Example: _SAPCAR_1010-70006178.EXE_
. On the Cloud Manager UI, click *Connector* to obtain the connector name.
. Log into https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/features/azure-portal/[Microsoft Azure portal^].
. Click *Virtual machines*.
. Search for the Cloud Manager Connector and copy the public IP address assigned to the Connector.
+
If the Connector does not have public IP  enabled, you should use a jump host.
. Copy the SAPCAR utility and HDB Client archive (.SAR) file to the Connector machine.
+
To copy the file to the Connector path, you need the credentials, or the key provided while creating the Connector.
+
* `scp <SAPCAR_utility> <usersername>@<IP_ADDRESS>:/home/<username>`
* `scp <HDB_Client_archive> <username>@<IP_ADDRESS>:/home/<username>`
+
The file are copied to _/home/<username>_.
. Log into the Connector VM with the ssh credentials or key.
. Run the following commands in the Connector VM to install the HDBSQL client in the AKS.
.. `sudo cp /home/<username>/<SAPCAR_utility> /var/lib/docker/volumes/cloudmanager_snapcenter_volume/_data/`
.. `sudo cp /home/<username>/< HDB_Client_archive> /var/lib/docker/volumes/cloudmanager_snapcenter_volume/_data/`
.. `sudo docker exec -it cloudmanager_snapcenter /bin/bash /opt/netapp/hdbclient/hdbclient.sh --archivefile <HDB_Client_archive> --archiveutil <SAPCAR_utility>`

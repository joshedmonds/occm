* To register pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems
+
Providing your NSS account is required to activate support for your system and to gain access to NetApp technical support resources.

* To upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP software to the latest release

* To use Active IQ Digital Advisor from within Cloud Manager

* If you plan to deploy a node-based BYOL system:
** The account must be authorized to access the serial numbers of the BYOL systems.

Cloud Manager requires permissions to perform actions in your cloud provider. These permissions are included in https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[the policies provided by NetApp^]. You might want to understand what Cloud Manager does with these permissions.

== What Cloud Manager does with AWS permissions

Cloud Manager uses an AWS account to make API calls to several AWS services, including EC2, S3, CloudFormation, IAM, the Security Token Service (STS), and the Key Management Service (KMS).

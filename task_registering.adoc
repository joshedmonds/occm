Support from NetApp is included with Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems, but you must first activate support by registering the systems with NetApp.

Registering a PAYGO system with NetApp is required to upgrade ONTAP software using any of the methods link:task_updating_ontap_cloud.html[described on this page].

TIP: A system that isn't registered for support will still receive the software update notifications that appear in Cloud Manager when a new version is available. But you will need to register the system before you can upgrade the software.

.Steps

. If you have not yet added your NetApp Support Site account to Cloud Manager, go to *Account Settings* and add it now.

. Click the menu icon and then click *Support registration*:

[.lead]
You can provision additional storage for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems from Cloud Manager by managing volumes and aggregates.

IMPORTANT: All disks and aggregates must be created and deleted directly from Cloud Manager. You should not perform these actions from another management tool. Doing so can impact system stability, hamper the ability to add disks in the future, and potentially generate redundant cloud provider fees.

== Creating FlexVol volumes

If you need more storage after you launch your initial Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you can create new FlexVol volumes for NFS, CIFS, or iSCSI from Cloud Manager.

A Cloud Manager feature called "templates" enables you to create volumes that are optimized for the workload requirements for certain applications; such as databases or streaming services. If your organization has created volume templates that you should use, follow <<Creating volumes from templates,these steps>>.

.About this task

When you create an iSCSI volume, Cloud Manager automatically creates a LUN for you. We’ve made it simple by creating just one LUN per volume, so there’s no management involved. After you create the volume, <<Connecting a LUN to a host,use the IQN to connect to the LUN from your hosts>>.

NOTE: You can create additional LUNs from System Manager or the CLI.

.Before you begin

If you want to use CIFS in AWS, you must have set up DNS and Active Directory. For details, see link:reference_networking_aws.html[Networking requirements for Cloud Volumes ONTAP for AWS].

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system on which you want to provision FlexVol volumes.

. Create a new volume on any aggregate or on a specific aggregate:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]

Some of the fields in this page are self-explanatory. The following table describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
include::_include/create_volume.adoc[]

. If you chose the CIFS protocol and the CIFS server has not been set up, specify details for the server in the Create a CIFS Server dialog box, and then click *Save and continue*:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| DNS Primary and Secondary IP Address | The IP addresses of the DNS servers that provide name resolution for the CIFS server.

The listed DNS servers must contain the service location records (SRV) needed to locate the Active Directory LDAP servers and domain controllers for the domain that the CIFS server will join.

| Active Directory Domain to join |	The FQDN of the Active Directory (AD) domain that you want the CIFS server to join.

| Credentials authorized to join the domain |	The name and password of a Windows account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the specified Organizational Unit (OU) within the AD domain.

| CIFS server NetBIOS name | A CIFS server name that is unique in the AD domain.

| Organizational Unit
a| The organizational unit within the AD domain to associate with the CIFS server. The default is CN=Computers.

* To configure AWS Managed Microsoft AD as the AD server for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you should enter *OU=Computers,OU=corp* in this field.

* To configure Azure AD Domain Services as the AD server for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you should enter *OU=AADDC Computers* or *OU=AADDC Users* in this field.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/create-ou[Azure Documentation: Create an Organizational Unit (OU) in an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain^]

| DNS Domain | The DNS domain for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM). In most cases, the domain is the same as the AD domain.

| NTP Server | Select *Use Active Directory Domain* to configure an NTP server using the Active Directory DNS. If you need to configure an NTP server using a different address, then you should use the API. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-automation/index.html[Cloud Manager automation docs^] for details.

* link:concept_data_tiering.html[Data tiering overview]

. Click *Go*.

.Result

Cloud Volumes ONTAP provisions the volume.

.After you finish

If you provisioned a CIFS share, give users or groups permissions to the files and folders and verify that those users can access the share and create a file.

If you want to apply quotas to volumes, you must use System Manager or the CLI. Quotas enable you to restrict or track the disk space and number of files used by a user, group, or qtree.

== Creating volumes from templates

If your organization has created Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume templates so you can deploy volumes that are optimized for the workload requirements for certain applications, follow the steps in this section.

The template should make your job easier because certain volume parameters will already be defined in the template, such as disk type, size, protocol, snapshot policy, cloud provider, and more. When a parameter is already predefined, you can just skip to the next volume parameter.

NOTE: You can only create NFS or CIFS volumes when using templates.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system on which you want to provision a volume.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[] > *Add Volume From Template*.
+
image:screenshot_template_add_vol_cvo.png[A screenshot showing how to add a new volume from a template.]

. In the _Select Template_ page, select the template that you want to use to create the volume and click *Next*.
+
image:screenshot_select_template_cvo.png[A screenshot of the available application templates.]
+
The _Define Parameters_ page is displayed.
+
image:screenshot_define_cvo_vol_from_template.png[A screenshot showing a blank template that you need to fill in to create a volume.]
+
*Note:* You can click the checkbox *Show read-only parameters* to show all the fields that have been locked by the template if you want to see the values for those parameters. By default these predefined fields are hidden and only the fields you need to complete are shown.

. In the _Context_ area, the Working Environment is filled in with the name of the working environment you started with. You need to select the *Storage VM* where the volume will be created.

. Add values for all of the parameters that are not hard-coded from the template. See <<Creating FlexVol volumes,creating volumes>> for details about all the parameters you need to complete to deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume.

. If there are no other Actions that you need to define (for example, configuring Cloud Backup), click *Run Template*.
+
If there are other actions, click the action in the left pane to display the parameters you need to complete.
+
image:screenshot_template_select_next_action.png[A screenshot showing how to select additional actions that need to be completed.]
+
For example, if the Enable Cloud Backup action requires that you select a backup policy, you can do that now.

. Click *Run Template*.

.Result

Cloud Volumes ONTAP provisions the volume and displays a page so that you can see the progress.

image:screenshot_template_creating_resource_cvo.png[A screenshot showing the progress of creating your new volume from the template.]

Additionally, if any secondary action is implemented in the template, for example, enabling Cloud Backup on the volume, that action is also performed.

.After you finish

If you provisioned a CIFS share, give users or groups permissions to the files and folders and verify that those users can access the share and create a file.

If you want to apply quotas to volumes, you must use System Manager or the CLI. Quotas enable you to restrict or track the disk space and number of files used by a user, group, or qtree.

== Creating FlexVol volumes on the second node in an HA configuration

By default, Cloud Manager creates volumes on the first node in an HA configuration. If you need an active-active configuration, in which both nodes serve data to clients, you must create aggregates and volumes on the second node.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment on which you want to manage aggregates.

. Click the menu icon and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

. Click *Add Aggregate* and then create the aggregate.

. For Home Node, choose the second node in the HA pair.

. After Cloud Manager creates the aggregate, select it and then click *Create volume*.

. Enter details for the new volume, and then click *Create*.

.After you finish

You can create additional volumes on this aggregate if required.

IMPORTANT: For HA pairs deployed in multiple AWS Availability Zones, you must mount the volume to clients by using the floating IP address of the node on which the volume resides.

== Creating aggregates

You can create aggregates yourself or let Cloud Manager do it for you when it creates volumes. The benefit of creating aggregates yourself is that you can choose the underlying disk size, which enables you to size your aggregate for the capacity or the performance that you need.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance on which you want to manage aggregates.

. Click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

. Click *Add Aggregate* and then specify details for the aggregate.
+
For help with disk type and disk size, see link:task_planning_your_config.html[Planning your configuration].

. Click *Go*, and then click *Approve and Purchase*.

== Connecting a LUN to a host

When you create an iSCSI volume, Cloud Manager automatically creates a LUN for you. We’ve made it simple by creating just one LUN per volume, so there’s no management involved. After you create the volume, use the IQN to connect to the LUN from your hosts.

Note the following:

. Cloud Manager's automatic capacity management doesn't apply to LUNs. When Cloud Manager creates a LUN, it disables the autogrow feature.

. You can create additional LUNs from System Manager or the CLI.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment on which you want to manage volumes.

. Select a volume, and then click *Target iQN*.

. Click *Copy* to copy the iQN name.

. Set up an iSCSI connection from the host to the LUN.

== Using FlexCache volumes to accelerate data access

A FlexCache volume is a storage volume that caches NFS read data from an origin (or source) volume. Subsequent reads to the cached data result in faster access to that data.

You can use FlexCache volumes to speed up access to data or to offload traffic from heavily accessed volumes. FlexCache volumes help improve performance, especially when clients need to access the same data repeatedly, because the data can be served directly without having to access the origin volume. FlexCache volumes work well for system workloads that are read-intensive.

Cloud Manager does not provide management of FlexCache volumes at this time, but you can use the ONTAP CLI or ONTAP System Manager to create and manage FlexCache volumes:

* http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.pow-fc-mgmt/home.html[FlexCache Volumes for Faster Data Access Power Guide^]
* http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.onc-sm-help-960/GUID-07F4C213-076D-4FE8-A8E3-410F49498D49.html[Creating FlexCache volumes in System Manager^]

Starting with the 3.7.2 release, Cloud Manager generates a FlexCache license for all new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. The license includes a 500 GiB usage limit.

NOTE: To generate the license, Cloud Manager needs to access \https://ipa-signer.cloudmanager.netapp.com. Make sure that this URL is accessible from your firewall.

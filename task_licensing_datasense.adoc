The first 1 TB of data that Cloud Data Sense scans in a Cloud Manager workspace is free. A BYOL license from NetApp, or a Cloud Manager subscription from your cloud provider's marketplace, is required to continue scanning data after that point.

A few notes before you read any further:

* If you've already subscribed to the Cloud Manager pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription in your cloud provider's marketplace, then you're automatically subscribed to Cloud Data Sense as well. You won’t need to subscribe again.
// You'll see an active subscription in the Digital Wallet.

* The Cloud Data Sense bring-your-own-license (BYOL) is a _floating_ license that you can use across all the working environments and data sources in the workspace that you plan to scan.

* There is no charge for scanning backup files created from your on-prem ONTAP volumes (created using link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup]). This data doesn't count against the capacity purchased in your license.

== Use a Cloud Data Sense PAYGO subscription

Pay-as-you-go subscriptions from your cloud provider's marketplace enable you to license the use of Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems and many Cloud Data Services, such as Cloud Data Sense.

You can subscribe at any time and you will not be charged until the amount of data exceeds 1 TB. You can always see the total amount of data that is being scanned from the Data Sense Dashboard. And the _Subscribe Now_ button makes it easy to subscribe when you are ready.

*Note:* If you are prompted by Cloud Data Sense to subscribe, but you already have an Azure subscription, you’re probably using the old *Cloud Manager* subscription and you need to change to the new *NetApp Cloud Manager* subscription. See <<Change to the new Cloud Manager plan in Azure,how to change to the new NetApp Cloud Manager plan in Azure>>.

.Steps

These steps must be completed by a user who has the _Account Admin_ role.

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

If you already have a subscription (shown below for AWS), then you're all set--there's nothing else that you need to do.

=== Change to the new Cloud Manager plan in Azure

Cloud Data Sense (Cloud Compliance) was added to the Azure Marketplace subscription named *NetApp Cloud Manager* as of October 2020. If you already have the original Azure *Cloud Manager* subscription it will not allow you to use Cloud Data Sense.

You need to follow these steps to change to the new *NetApp Cloud Manager* subscription before you can start using Cloud Data Sense.

NOTE: If your existing Subscription was issued with a special private offer, you need to contact NetApp so that we can issue a new special private offer with Data Sense included.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. Find the credentials for the Azure Managed Service Identity that you want to change the subscription for and hover over the credentials and click *Associate Subscription*.
+
The details for your current Marketplace Subscription are displayed.

. Log in to the link:https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.SaaS%2Fsaasresources[Azure portal^] and select *Software as a Service (SaaS)*.

. Select the subscription for which you want to change the plan and click *Change Plan*.
+

. In the Change Plan page, select the *NetApp Cloud Manager* plan and click the *Change Plan* button.

. Return to Cloud Manager, select the subscription, and hover over the “i” above subscription in the Credentials card to verify your subscription has changed.

== Use a Cloud Data Sense BYOL license

Bring-your-own licenses from NetApp provide 1-, 2-, or 3-year terms. The BYOL *Cloud Data Sense* license is a _floating_ license where the total capacity is shared among *all* of your working environments and data sources, making initial licensing and renewal easy.

If you don't have a Cloud Data Sense license, contact us to purchase one:

* mailto:ng-contact-data-sense@netapp.com?subject=Licensing[Send email to purchase a license].
* Click the chat icon in the lower-right of Cloud Manager to request a license.

You use the Digital Wallet page in Cloud Manager to manage Cloud Data Sense BYOL licenses. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

=== Obtain your Cloud Data Sense license file

After you have purchased your Cloud Data Sense license, you activate the license in Cloud Manager by entering the Cloud Data Sense serial number and NSS account, or by uploading the NLF license file. The steps below show how to get the NLF license file if you plan to use that method.

.Steps

. Sign in to the https://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support Site^] and click *Systems > Software Licenses*.

. Enter your Cloud Data Sense license serial number.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_tiering_license_step1.gif[A screenshot that shows a table of licenses after searching by serial number.]

+
image:screenshot_cloud_tiering_license_step2.gif[A screenshot that shows the get license dialog box where you enter your tenant ID and then click Submit to download the license file.]
+
You can find your Cloud Manager Account ID by selecting the *Account* drop-down from the top of Cloud Manager, and then clicking *Manage Account* next to your account. Your Account ID is in the Overview tab.

=== Add Cloud Data Sense BYOL licenses to your account

After you purchase a Cloud Data Sense license for your Cloud Manager account, you need to add the license to Cloud Manager to use the Cloud Data Sense service.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Data Services Licenses*.

. Click *Add License*.

. In the _Add License_ dialog, enter the license information and click *Add License*:
+
* If you have the Data Sense license serial number and know your NSS account, select the *Enter Serial Number* option and enter that information.
+
If your NetApp Support Site account isn't available from the drop-down list, link:task_adding_nss_accounts.html[add the NSS account to Cloud Manager^].
* If you have the Data Sense license file, select the *Upload License File* option and follow the prompts to attach the file.

=== Update a Cloud Data Sense BYOL license

If your licensed term is nearing the expiration date, or if your licensed capacity is reaching the limit, you'll be notified in Cloud Data Sense.

This status also appears in the Digital Wallet page.

image:screenshot_services_license_expire_cc2.png[A screenshot that shows an expiring license in the Digital Wallet page.]

You can update your Cloud Data Sense license before it expires so that there is no interruption in your ability to scan your data.

.Steps

. Click the chat icon in the lower-right of Cloud Manager to request an extension or capacity add-on to your Cloud Data Sense license for the particular serial number.
+
After you pay for the license and it is registered with the NetApp Support Site, in most cases, Cloud Manager can automatically obtain your updated license file and the Data Services Licenses page will reflect the change in 5 to 10 minutes.

. If Cloud Manager can't automatically update the license, then you’ll need to manually upload the license file.
.. You can <<Obtain your Cloud Data Sense license file,obtain the license file from the NetApp Support Site>>.
.. On the Digital Wallet page in the _Data Services Licenses_ tab, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the service serial number you are updating, and click *Update License*.
+
image:screenshot_services_license_update.png[A screenshot of selecting the Update License button for a particular service.]
.. In the _Update License_ page, upload the license file and click *Update License*.

This page highlights important changes in Cloud Manager that can help you use the service as we introduce new enhancements. You should continue to read the link:reference_new_occm.html[What's new] page to learn about all new features and enhancements.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP AMI change

Starting with the 9.8 release, the Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO AMI is no longer available in the AWS Marketplace. If you use the Cloud Manager API to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO, you'll need to https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[subscribe to the Cloud Manager subscription in the AWS Marketplace^] before deploying a 9.8 system.

== SaaS changes

We have introduced a software-as-a-service experience for Cloud Manager. This new experience makes it easier for you to use Cloud Manager and enables us to provide additional features to manage your hybrid cloud infrastructure.

* link:concept_saas.html[Cloud Manager transition to SaaS]
* link:concept_overview.html[Learn how Cloud Manager works]

== Machine type changes

To ensure that adequate resources are available for new and upcoming features in Cloud Manager, we've changed the minimum required instance, VM, and machine type as follows:

* AWS: t3.xlarge
* Azure: DS3 v2
* GCP: n1-standard-4

When you upgrade the machine type, you'll get access to features like a new Kubernetes experience, Global File Cache, Monitoring, and more.

These default sizes are the minimum supported link:reference_cloud_mgr_reqs.html[based on CPU and RAM requirements].

Cloud Manager will prompt you with instructions to change the machine type of the Connector.

== Account settings

We introduced NetApp accounts to provide multi-tenancy, to help you organize users and resources in isolated workspaces, and to manage access to Connectors and subscriptions.

* link:concept_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn about NetApp accounts: users, workspaces, Connectors, and subscriptions]
* link:task_setting_up_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn how to get started with your account]
* link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn how to manage your account after you set it up]

== New permissions

Cloud Manager occasionally requires additional cloud provider permissions as we introduce new features and enhancements. This section identifies new permissions that are now required.

You can find the latest list of permissions on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policies page^].

=== Azure

* Starting with the 3.9.12 release, Cloud Manager configures an application security group for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair, which isolates the HA interconnect and cluster network NICs. A Connector requires the following new permissions to enable this configuration:

[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/delete",
"Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets/delete",

* Starting with the 3.9.7 release, Cloud Manager can now delete older cloud snapshots of root and boot disks that are created when a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is deployed and every time its powered down. A Connector requires a new permission to delete Azure snapshots:

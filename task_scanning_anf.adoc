Complete a few steps to get started with Cloud Data Sense for  Azure NetApp Files.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Click *Compliance*, select the *Configuration* tab, and activate compliance scans for volumes in specific working environments.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Now that Cloud Data Sense is enabled, ensure that it can access all volumes.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* The Cloud Data Sense instance needs a network connection to each Azure NetApp Files subnet.
* Make sure these ports are open to the Data Sense instance:
** For NFS – ports 111 and 2049.
** For CIFS – ports 139 and 445.
* NFS volume export policies must allow access from the Data Sense instance.
* Data Sense needs Active Directory credentials to scan CIFS volumes.
+
Click *Compliance* > *Configuration* > *Edit CIFS Credentials* and provide the credentials.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select or deselect the volumes that you want to scan and Cloud Data Sense will start or stop scanning them.

== Discovering the Azure NetApp Files system that you want to scan

If the Azure NetApp Files system you want to scan is not already in Cloud Manager as a working environment, you can add it to the canvas at this time.

link:task_manage_anf.html[See how to discover the Azure NetApp Files system in Cloud Manager^].

== Deploying the Cloud Data Sense instance

link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[Deploy Cloud Data Sense^] if there isn't already an instance deployed.

Data Sense must be deployed in the cloud when scanning Azure NetApp Files volumes, and it must be deployed in the same region as the volumes you wish to scan.

== Enabling Cloud Data Sense in your working environments

You can enable Cloud Data Sense on your Azure NetApp Files volumes.

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Data Sense* and then select the *Configuration* tab.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_anf_scan_config.png[A screenshot of the Configuration tab immediately after deploying the Cloud Data Sense instance.]

. Select how you want to scan the volumes in each working environment. link:concept_cloud_compliance.html#whats-the-difference-between-mapping-and-classification-scans[Learn about mapping and classification scans]:

* To map all volumes, click *Map all Volumes*.
* To map and classify all volumes, click *Map & Classify all Volumes*.
* To customize scanning for each volume, click *Or select scanning type for each volume*, and then choose the volumes you want to map and/or classify.
+
See <<Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes,Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes>> for details.

. In the confirmation dialog box, click *Approve* to have Data Sense start scanning your volumes.

.Result

Cloud Data Sense starts scanning the volumes you selected in the working environment. Results will be available in the Compliance dashboard as soon as Cloud Data Sense finishes the initial scans. The time that it takes depends on the amount of data--it could be a few minutes or hours.

== Verifying that Cloud Data Sense has access to volumes

Make sure that Cloud Data Sense can access volumes by checking your networking, security groups, and export policies. You'll need to provide Data Sense with CIFS credentials so it can access CIFS volumes.

.Steps

. Make sure that there's a network connection between the Cloud Data Sense instance and each network that includes volumes for Azure NetApp Files.
+
NOTE: For Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Data Sense can only scan volumes that are in the same region as Cloud Manager.

. Ensure the following ports are open to the Data Sense instance:
** For NFS – ports 111 and 2049.
** For CIFS – ports 139 and 445.

. Ensure that NFS volume export policies include the IP address of the Data Sense instance so it can access the data on each volume.

. If you use CIFS, provide Data Sense with Active Directory credentials so it can scan CIFS volumes.

.. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Data Sense*.

.. Click the *Configuration* tab.
+
image:screenshot_cifs_credentials.gif[A screenshot of the Compliance tab that shows the Scan Status button that's available in the top right of the content pane.]

.. For each working environment, click *Edit CIFS Credentials* and enter the user name and password that Data Sense needs to access CIFS volumes on the system.
+
The credentials can be read-only, but providing admin credentials ensures that Data Sense can read any data that requires elevated permissions. The credentials are stored on the Cloud Data Sense instance.
+
After you enter the credentials, you should see a message that all CIFS volumes were authenticated successfully.
+
image:screenshot_cifs_status.gif[A screenshot that shows the Configuration page and one Cloud Volumes ONTAP system for which CIFS credentials were successfully provided.]

. On the _Configuration_ page, click *View Details* to review the status for each CIFS and NFS volume and correct any errors.
+
For example, the following image shows four volumes; one of which Cloud Data Sense can't scan due to network connectivity issues between the Data Sense instance and the volume.

== Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes

You can start or stop mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, in a working environment at any time from the Configuration page. You can also change from mapping-only scans to mapping and classification scans, and vice-versa. We recommend that you scan all volumes.

|===
| To:
| Do this:

| Enable mapping-only scans on a volume | In the volume area, click *Map*
| Enable full scanning on a volume | In the volume area, click *Map & Classify*
| Disable scanning on a volume | In the volume area, click *Off*
| |
| Enable mapping-only scans on all volumes | In the heading area, click *Map*
| Enable full scanning on all volumes | In the heading area, click *Map & Classify*
| Disable scanning on all volumes | In the heading area, click *Off*

|===

NOTE: New volumes added to the working environment are automatically scanned only when you have set the *Map* or *Map & Classify* setting in the heading area. When set to *Custom* or *Off* in the heading area, you'll need to activate mapping and/or full scanning on each new volume you add in the working environment.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add the list of users from the OneDrive account that you want to scan and select the type of scanning. You can add up to 100 users at time.

== Reviewing OneDrive requirements

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Data Sense.

* You must have the Admin login credentials for the OneDrive for Business account that provides read access to all user files.
* You will need a line-separated list of the email addresses for all the users whose OneDrive folders you want to scan.

== Deploying the Cloud Data Sense instance

Deploy Cloud Data Sense if there isn't already an instance deployed.

Data Sense can be link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

Upgrades to Data Sense software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

Data Sense can also be link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deployed in an on-premises location that has no internet access^]. However, you'll need to provide internet access to a few select endpoints to scan OneDrive files. link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html#sharepoint-and-onedrive-special-requirements[See the list of required endpoints here].

== Adding the OneDrive account

Add the OneDrive account where the user files reside.

.Steps

. In the Add a OneDrive account dialog, click *Sign in to OneDrive*.

. In the Microsoft page that appears, select the OneDrive account and enter the required Admin user and password, then click *Accept* to allow Cloud Data Sense to read data from this account.

The OneDrive account is added to the list of working environments.

== Adding OneDrive users to compliance scans

You can add individual OneDrive users, or all of your OneDrive users, so that their files will be scanned by Cloud Data Sense.

.Steps

. From the _Configuration_ page, click the *Configuration* button for the OneDrive account.

. Add the email addresses for the users whose files you want to scan - one email address per line (up to 100 maximum per session) - and click *Add Users*.
+

+
A confirmation dialog displays the number of users who were added.

If the dialog lists any users who could not be added, capture this information so that you can resolve the issue. In some cases you can re-add the user with a corrected email address.

. Enable mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, on user files.

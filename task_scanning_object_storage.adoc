summary: Complete a few steps to start scanning data within object storage directly with Cloud Data Sense. Data Sense can scan data from any Object Storage service which uses the Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol. This includes NetApp StorageGRID, IBM Cloud Object Store, Azure Blob (using MinIO), Linode, B2 Cloud Storage, and more.

Complete a few steps to start scanning data within object storage directly with Cloud Data Sense. Data Sense can scan data from any Object Storage service which uses the Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol. This includes NetApp StorageGRID, IBM Cloud Object Store, Azure Blob (using MinIO), Linode, B2 Cloud Storage, and more.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the buckets that you'd like to scan and Cloud Data Sense will start scanning them.

== Reviewing object storage requirements

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Data Sense.

* You need to have the endpoint URL to connect with the object storage service.

* You need to have the Access Key and Secret Key from the object storage provider so that Data Sense can access the buckets.

* Support for Azure Blob requires that you use the link:https://min.io/[MinIO service^].

== Deploying the Cloud Data Sense instance

Deploy Cloud Data Sense if there isn't already an instance deployed.

Data Sense can be link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

Upgrades to Data Sense software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

== Adding the object storage service to Cloud Data Sense

Add the object storage service.

.Steps

. From the Working Environments Configuration page, click *Add Data Source* > *Add Object Storage Service*.
+

. In the Add Object Storage Service dialog, enter the details for the object storage service and click *Continue*.
.. Enter the name you want to use for the Working Environment. This name should reflect the name of the object storage service to which you are connecting.
.. Enter the Endpoint URL to access the object storage service.
.. Enter the Access Key and Secret Key so that Cloud Data Sense can access the buckets in the object storage.

.Result

The new Object Storage Service is added to the list of working environments.

== Enabling and disabling compliance scans on object storage buckets

After you enable Cloud Data Sense on your Object Storage Service, the next step is to configure the buckets that you want to scan. Data Sense discovers those buckets and displays them in the working environment you created.

.Steps

. In the Configuration page, click *Configuration* from the Object Storage Service working environment.
+

. Enable mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, on your buckets.

| To:
| Do this:

| Enable mapping-only scans on a bucket | Click *Map*
| Enable full scans on a bucket | Click *Map & Classify*
| Disable scanning on a bucket | Click *Off*

.Result

Cloud Data Sense starts scanning the buckets that you enabled. If there are any errors, they'll appear in the Status column, alongside the required action to fix the error.

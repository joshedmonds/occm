Cloud Manager handles the set up of networking components for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, such as IP addresses, netmasks, and routes. You need to make sure that outbound internet access is available, that enough private IP addresses are available, that the right connections are in place, and more.

== General requirements

The following requirements must be met in AWS.

=== Outbound internet access for Cloud Volumes ONTAP nodes

Cloud Volumes ONTAP nodes require outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.

Routing and firewall policies must allow AWS HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:

* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* \https://support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup

If you have a NAT instance, you must define an inbound security group rule that allows HTTPS traffic from the private subnet to the internet.

link:task_setting_up_ontap_cloud.html[Learn how to configure AutoSupport].

=== Outbound internet access for the HA mediator

The HA mediator instance must have an outbound connection to the AWS EC2 service so it can assist with storage failover. To provide the connection, you can add a public IP address, specify a proxy server, or use a manual option.

The manual option can be a NAT gateway or an interface VPC endpoint from the target subnet to the AWS EC2 service. For details about VPC endpoints, refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpce-interface.html[AWS Documentation: Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)^].

=== Private IP addresses

Cloud Manager automatically allocates the required number of private IP addresses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. You need to ensure that your networking has enough private IP addresses available.

The number of LIFs that Cloud Manager allocates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP depends on whether you deploy a single node system or an HA pair. A LIF is an IP address associated with a physical port.

==== IP addresses for a single node system

Cloud Manager allocates 6 IP addresses to a single node system:

* Cluster management LIF
* Node management LIF
* Intercluster LIF
* NAS data LIF
* iSCSI data LIF
* Storage VM management LIF
+
A storage VM management LIF is used with management tools like SnapCenter.

==== IP addresses for HA pairs

HA pairs require more IP addresses than a single node system does. These IP addresses are spread across different ethernet interfaces, as shown in the following image:

image:diagram_cvo_aws_networking_ha.png["A diagram that shows eth0, eth1, eth2 on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configuration in AWS."]

The number of private IP addresses required for an HA pair depends on which deployment model you choose. An HA pair deployed in a _single_ AWS Availability Zone (AZ) requires 15 private IP addresses, while an HA pair deployed in _multiple_ AZs requires 13 private IP addresses.

The following tables provide details about the LIFs that are associated with each private IP address.

|===

TIP: When deployed in multiple Availability Zones, several LIFs are associated with link:reference_networking_aws.html#floatingips[floating IP addresses], which don't count against the AWS private IP limit.

=== Security groups

You do not need to create security groups because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to link:reference_security_groups.html[Security group rules].

=== Connection for data tiering

If you want to use EBS as a performance tier and AWS S3 as a capacity tier, you must ensure that Cloud Volumes ONTAP has a connection to S3. The best way to provide that connection is by creating a VPC Endpoint to the S3 service. For instructions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpce-gateway.html#create-gateway-endpoint[AWS Documentation: Creating a Gateway Endpoint^].

When you create the VPC Endpoint, be sure to select the region, VPC, and route table that corresponds to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. You must also modify the security group to add an outbound HTTPS rule that enables traffic to the S3 endpoint. Otherwise, Cloud Volumes ONTAP cannot connect to the S3 service.

If you experience any issues, see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/connect-s3-vpc-endpoint/[AWS Support Knowledge Center: Why can’t I connect to an S3 bucket using a gateway VPC endpoint?^]

=== Connections to ONTAP systems

To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in AWS and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the AWS VPC and the other network—for example, an Azure VNet or your corporate network. For instructions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/SetUpVPNConnections.html[AWS Documentation: Setting Up an AWS VPN Connection^].

=== DNS and Active Directory for CIFS

If you want to provision CIFS storage, you must set up DNS and Active Directory in AWS or extend your on-premises setup to AWS.

The DNS server must provide name resolution services for the Active Directory environment. You can configure DHCP option sets to use the default EC2 DNS server, which must not be the DNS server used by the Active Directory environment.

For instructions, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/active-directory-ds/welcome.html[AWS Documentation: Active Directory Domain Services on the AWS Cloud: Quick Start Reference Deployment^].

== Requirements for HA pairs in multiple AZs

Additional AWS networking requirements apply to Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configurations that use multiple Availability Zones (AZs). You should review these requirements before you launch an HA pair because you must enter the networking details in Cloud Manager when you create the working environment.

To understand how HA pairs work, see link:concept_ha.html[High-availability pairs].

Availability Zones::
This HA deployment model uses multiple AZs to ensure high availability of your data. You should use a dedicated AZ for each Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance and the mediator instance, which provides a communication channel between the HA pair.

A subnet should be available in each Availability Zone.

[[floatingips]]
Floating IP addresses for NAS data and cluster/SVM management::
HA configurations in multiple AZs use floating IP addresses that migrate between nodes if failures occur. They are not natively accessible from outside the VPC, unless you link:task_setting_up_transit_gateway.html[set up an AWS transit gateway].
+
One floating IP address is for cluster management, one is for NFS/CIFS data on node 1, and one is for NFS/CIFS data on node 2. A fourth floating IP address for SVM management is optional.
+
NOTE: A floating IP address is required for the SVM management LIF if you use SnapDrive for Windows or SnapCenter with the HA pair. If you don't specify the IP address when you deploy the system, you can create the LIF later. For details, see link:task_setting_up_ontap_cloud.html[Setting up Cloud Volumes ONTAP].
+
You need to enter the floating IP addresses in Cloud Manager when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA working environment. Cloud Manager allocates the IP addresses to the HA pair when it launches the system.
+
The floating IP addresses must be outside of the CIDR blocks for all VPCs in the AWS region in which you deploy the HA configuration. Think of the floating IP addresses as a logical subnet that's outside of the VPCs in your region.
+
The following example shows the relationship between floating IP addresses and the VPCs in an AWS region. While the floating IP addresses are outside the CIDR blocks for all VPCs, they're routable to subnets through route tables.
+
image:diagram_ha_floating_ips.png[A conceptual image showing the CIDR blocks for five VPCs in an AWS region and three floating IP addresses that are outside the CIDR blocks of the VPCs.]
+
NOTE: Cloud Manager automatically creates static IP addresses for iSCSI access and for NAS access from clients outside the VPC. You don't need to meet any requirements for these types of IP addresses.

Transit gateway to enable floating IP access from outside the VPC::
If needed, link:task_setting_up_transit_gateway.html[set up an AWS transit gateway] to enable access to an HA pair's floating IP addresses from outside the VPC where the HA pair resides.

Route tables::
After you specify the floating IP addresses in Cloud Manager, you are then prompted to select the route tables that should include routes to the floating IP addresses. This enables client access to the HA pair.
+
If you have just one route table for the subnets in your VPC (the main route table), then Cloud Manager automatically adds the floating IP addresses to that route table. If you have more than one route table, it's very important to select the correct route tables when launching the HA pair. Otherwise, some clients might not have access to Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
For example, you might have two subnets that are associated with different route tables. If you select route table A, but not route table B, then clients in the subnet associated with route table A can access the HA pair, but clients in the subnet associated with route table B can't.
+
For more information about route tables, refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html[AWS Documentation: Route Tables^].

Connection to NetApp management tools::
To use NetApp management tools with HA configurations that are in multiple AZs, you have two connection options:

. Deploy the NetApp management tools in a different VPC and link:task_setting_up_transit_gateway.html[set up an AWS transit gateway]. The gateway enables access to the floating IP address for the cluster management interface from outside the VPC.

. Deploy the NetApp management tools in the same VPC with a similar routing configuration as NAS clients.

=== Example HA configuration

The following image illustrates the networking components specific to an HA pair in multiple AZs: three Availability Zones, three subnets, floating IP addresses, and a route table.

image:diagram_ha_networking.png["Conceptual image showing components in a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA architecture: two Cloud Volumes ONTAP nodes and a mediator instance, each in separate availability zones."]

== Requirements for the Connector

Set up your networking so that the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, you can specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Configuring the Connector to use a proxy server].

=== Connection to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the VPCs and VNets in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

For example, if you install a Connector in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the VPC or VNet in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Outbound internet access

Outbound internet access is required from the Connector and from your web browser. The following sections identify the specific endpoints.

NOTE: If your VPC uses a network access control list (ACL) to filter traffic, then make sure that you enable these endpoints for both outbound and inbound traffic.

=== Endpoints to manage resources in your public cloud environment

The Connector requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Endpoints
| Purpose

| \https://support.netapp.com | To obtain licensing information and to send AutoSupport messages to NetApp support.
| \https://*.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com | To provide SaaS features and services within Cloud Manager.
| \https://hub.docker.com
\https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io  | To upgrade the Connector and its Docker components.

|===

==== Endpoints accessed from your web browser when using the UI

The Cloud Manager user interface is accessible from a web browser. The machine running the web browser must have connections to the following endpoints.

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Endpoints
| Purpose

| \http://cloudmanager.netapp.com | Your web browser contacts this URL when using the SaaS UI.

| The Connector’s IP address
a| In most cases, you should work with Cloud Manager from the SaaS UI, but if you need to use the link:concept_connectors.html#using-multiple-connectors-with-the-same-working-environment[local UI], then you must enter the host’s IP address from a web browser to load the Cloud Manager console.

Depending on the connectivity to your cloud provider, you can use the private IP or a public IP assigned to the host:

- A private IP works if you have a VPN and direct connect access to your virtual network
- A public IP works in any networking scenario

In any case, you should secure network access by ensuring that security group rules allow access from only authorized IPs or subnets.

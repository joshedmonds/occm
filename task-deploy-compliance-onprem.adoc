Complete a few steps to deploy Cloud Data Sense on a Linux host in your network, or in the cloud, that has internet access.

The on-prem installation may be a good option if you prefer to scan on-premises ONTAP systems using a Data Sense instance that's also located on premises -- but this is not a requirement. The software functions exactly the same way regardless of which installation method you choose.

Note that you can also link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deploy Data Sense in an on-premises site that doesn't have internet access] for completely secure sites.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't already have a Connector, create a Connector now. See link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[creating a Connector in AWS^], link:task_creating_connectors_azure.html[creating a Connector in Azure^], or link:task_creating_connectors_gcp.html[creating a Connector in GCP^].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can also link:task_installing_linux.html[deploy the Connector on-premises^] on a Linux host in your network or in the cloud.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Review prerequisites

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure that your environment can meet the prerequisites. This includes outbound internet access for the instance, connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Data Sense over port 443, and more. <<Verify Cloud Manager and Data Sense prerequisites,See the complete list>>.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You also need a Linux system that meets the <<Prepare the Linux host system,following requirements>>.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Deploy Cloud Data Sense

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Download the Cloud Data Sense software from the NetApp Support Site and copy the installer file to the Linux host you plan to use. Then launch the installation wizard and follow the prompts to deploy the Data Sense instance.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Subscribe to the Cloud Data Sense service

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The first 1 TB of data that Cloud Data Sense scans in Cloud Manager is free. A subscription to your cloud provider Marketplace, or a BYOL license from NetApp, is required to continue scanning data after that point.

== Create a Connector

If you don't already have a Connector, create a Connector in your cloud provider. See link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[creating a Connector in AWS^] or link:task_creating_connectors_azure.html[creating a Connector in Azure^], or link:task_creating_connectors_gcp.html[creating a Connector in GCP^]. In most cases you will probably have a Connector set up before you attempt to activate Cloud Data Sense because most link:concept_connectors.html#when-a-connector-is-required[Cloud Manager features require a Connector], but there are cases where you'll you need to set one up now.

There are some scenarios where you have to use a Connector that's deployed in a specific cloud provider:

* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS, Amazon FSx for ONTAP, or in AWS S3 buckets, you use a connector in AWS.
* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure or in Azure NetApp Files, you use a connector in Azure.
* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP, you use a connector in GCP.

On-prem ONTAP systems, non-NetApp file shares, generic S3 Object storage, databases, OneDrive folders, and SharePoint accounts can be scanned using any of these cloud Connectors.

Note that you can also link:task_installing_linux.html[deploy the Connector on-premises^] on a Linux host in your network or in the cloud. Some users planning to install Data Sense on-prem may also choose to install the Connector on-prem.

As you can see, there may be some situations where you need to use link:concept_connectors.html#when-to-use-multiple-connectors[multiple Connectors].

NOTE: If you're planning on scanning Azure NetApp Files volumes, you need to make sure you're deploying in the same region as the volumes you wish to scan.

== Prepare the Linux host system

Data Sense software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, software requirements, and so on. The host must be a dedicated host -- Data Sense is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications.

* Operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS version 8.0 or 8.1
** Version 7.8 can be used, but the Linux kernel version must be 4.14 or greater
** The OS must be capable of installing the docker engine (for example, disable the _firewalld_ service if needed)
* Disk: SSD with 500 GiB available on /, or
** 100 GiB available on /opt
** 400 GiB available on /var
* RAM: 64 GB (swap memory must be disabled on the host)
* CPU: 16 cores
+
Note that you can deploy Data Sense on a system with fewer CPUs and less RAM, but there are limitations when using these systems. See link:concept_cloud_compliance.html#using-a-smaller-instance-type[Using a smaller instance type] for details.

* A Red Hat Enterprise Linux system must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it's not registered, the system can't access repositories to update required 3rd party software during installation.

* The following software must be installed on the host. If it doesn't already exist on the host, then the installer will install the software for you:

** Docker Engine version 19 or later. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^].
** Python 3 version 3.6 or later. https://www.python.org/downloads/[View installation instructions^].

== Verify Cloud Manager and Data Sense prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you deploy Cloud Data Sense on a Linux system.

Enable outbound internet access from Cloud Data Sense::
Cloud Data Sense requires outbound internet access. If your virtual or physical network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the Data Sense instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints.
+

|===

Ensure that Cloud Manager has the required permissions::
Ensure that Cloud Manager has permissions to deploy resources and create security groups for the Cloud Data Sense instance. You can find the latest Cloud Manager permissions in https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[the policies provided by NetApp^].
+
*Note:* If you created the Connector in GCP using Cloud Manager 3.9.10 or greater, then you’re all set. If you created the Connector using an earlier version, then you’ll need to add the following permissions to the GCP service account associated with the Connector to deploy Cloud Data Sense to GCP.
+
[source,json]
compute.instances.addAccessConfig
compute.subnetworks.use
compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp

Ensure that the Cloud Manager Connector can access Cloud Data Sense::
Ensure connectivity between the Connector and the Cloud Data Sense instance. The security group for the Connector must allow inbound and outbound traffic over port 443 to and from the Data Sense instance.
+
This connection enables deployment of the Data Sense instance and enables you to view information in the Compliance and Governance tabs.
+
Make sure port 8080 is open so you can see the installation progress in Cloud Manager.

Ensure that you can keep Cloud Data Sense running::
The Cloud Data Sense instance needs to stay on to continuously scan your data.

Ensure web browser connectivity to Cloud Data Sense::
After Cloud Data Sense is enabled, ensure that users access the Cloud Manager interface from a host that has a connection to the Data Sense instance.
+
The Data Sense instance uses a private IP address to ensure that the indexed data isn't accessible to the internet. As a result, the web browser that you use to access Cloud Manager must have a connection to that private IP address. That connection can come from a direct connection to your cloud provider (for example, a VPN), or from a host that's inside the same network as the Data Sense instance.

== Deploy Data Sense on premises

For typical configurations you'll install the software on a single host system. <<Single-host installation for typical configurations,See those steps here>>.

For very large configurations where you'll be scanning petabytes of data, you can include multiple hosts to provide additional processing power. <<Multi-host installation for large configurations,See those steps here>>.

See <<Prepare the Linux host system,Preparing the Linux host system>> and <<Verify Cloud Manager and Data Sense prerequisites,Reviewing prerequisites>> for the full list of requirements before you deploy Cloud Data Sense.

Upgrades to Data Sense software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

NOTE: Cloud Data Sense is currently unable to scan S3 buckets, Azure NetApp Files, or FSx for ONTAP when the software is installed on premises. In these cases you'll need to deploy a separate Connector and instance of Data Sense in the cloud and link:concept_connectors.html#when-to-switch-between-connectors[switch between Connectors^] for your different data sources.

=== Single-host installation for typical configurations

Follow these steps when installing Data Sense software on a single on-premises host.

.What you'll need

* Verify that your Linux system meets the <<Prepare the Linux host system,host requirements>>.
* (Optional) Verify that the system has the two prerequisite software packages installed (Docker Engine and Python 3). The installer will install this software if it is not already on the system.
* Make sure you have root privileges on the Linux system.
* Verify that your offline environment meets the required <<Verify Cloud Manager and Data Sense prerequisites,permissions and connectivity>>.

.Steps

. Download the Cloud Data Sense software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-data-sense/downloads-tab/[NetApp Support Site^]. The file you should select is named *cc_onprem_installer_<version>.tar.gz*.

. Copy the installer file to the Linux host you plan to use (using `scp` or some other method).

. In Cloud Manager, click *Data Sense*.

. Click *Activate Data Sense*.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_deploy_start.png[A screenshot of selecting the button to activate Cloud Data Sense.]

. Click *Activate Data Sense* to start the on-prem deployment wizard.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_deploy_onprem.png[A screenshot of selecting the button to deploy Cloud Data Sense on premises.]

. In the _Deploy Data Sense On Premises_ dialog, copy the provided command and paste it in a text file so you can use it later, and click *Close*. For example:
+
`sudo ./install.sh -a 12345 -c 27AG75 -t 2198qq`

. Unzip the installer file on the host machine, for example:
+
[source,cli]
tar -xzf cc_onprem_installer_1.7.2.tar.gz

. When prompted by the installer, you can enter the required values in a series of prompts, or you can enter the complete command in the first prompt:

+
[cols="50a,50",options="header"]
|===
| Enter parameters as prompted:
| Enter the full command:

|
a. Paste the information you copied from step 6:
`sudo ./install.sh -a <account_id> -c <agent_id> -t <token>`
b. Enter the IP address of the Data Sense host machine so it can be accessed by the Connector instance.
c. Enter the IP address of the Cloud Manager Connector host machine so it can be accessed by the Data Sense instance.
d. Enter proxy details as prompted. If your Cloud Manager already uses a proxy, there is no need to enter this information again here since Data Sense will automatically use the proxy used by Cloud Manager.
| Alternatively, you can create the whole command in advance and enter it in the first prompt:
`sudo ./install.sh -a <account_id> -c <agent_id> -t <token> --host <ds_host> --cm-host <cm_host> --proxy-host <proxy_host> --proxy-port <proxy_port> --proxy-scheme <proxy_scheme> --proxy-user <proxy_user> --proxy-password <proxy_password>`
|===

+
Variable values:

* _account_id_ = NetApp Account ID
* _agent_id_ = Connector ID
* _token_ = jwt user token
* _ds_host_ = IP address of the Data Sense Linux system.
* _cm_host_ = IP address of the Cloud Manager Connector system.
* _proxy_host_ = IP address of the proxy server, if the host is behind a proxy server.
* _proxy_port_ = Port to connect to the proxy server (default 80).
* _proxy_scheme_ = Connection scheme: https or http (default http).
* _proxy_user_ = Authenticated user to connect to the proxy server, if basic authentication is required.
* _proxy_password_ = Password for the user name that you specified.

.Result

The Cloud Data Sense installer installs packages, installs docker, registers the installation, and installs Data Sense. Installation can take 10 to 20 minutes.

If there is connectivity over port 8080 between the host machine and the Connector instance, you will see the installation progress in the Data Sense tab in Cloud Manager.

.What's Next
From the Configuration page you can select the data sources that you want to scan.

You can also link:task_licensing_datasense.html[set up licensing for Cloud Data Sense] at this time. You will not be charged until the amount of data exceeds 1 TB.

=== Multi-host installation for large configurations

For very large configurations where you’ll be scanning petabytes of data, you can include multiple hosts to provide additional processing power. When using multiple host systems, the primary system is called the _Manager node_ and the additional systems that provide extra processing power are called _Scanner nodes_.

Follow these steps when installing Data Sense software on multiple on-premises hosts.

.What you'll need

* Verify that all your Linux systems for the Manager and Scanner nodes meet the <<Prepare the Linux host system,host requirements>>.
* (Optional) Verify that the systems have the two prerequisite software packages installed (Docker Engine and Python 3). The installer will install this software if it is not already on the systems.
* Make sure you have root privileges on the Linux systems.
* Verify that your environment meets the required <<Verify Cloud Manager and Data Sense prerequisites,permissions and connectivity>>.
* You must have the IP addresses of the scanner node hosts that you plan to use.
* The following ports and protocols must be enabled on all hosts:
+
[cols="15,20,55",options="header"]
|===
| Port
| Protocols
| Description

|2377 | TCP | Cluster management communications
|7946 | TCP, UDP | Inter-node communication
|4789 | UDP | Overlay network traffic
|50 | ESP | Encrypted IPsec overlay network (ESP) traffic
|111 | TCP, UDP | NFS Server for sharing files between the hosts (needed from each scanner node to manager node)
|2049 | TCP, UDP | NFS Server for sharing files between the hosts (needed from each scanner node to manager node)

|===

.Steps

. Follow steps 1 through 7 from the <<Single-host installation for typical configurations,Single-host installation>> on the manager node.

. As shown in step 8, when prompted by the installer, you can enter the required values in a series of prompts, or you can enter the complete command in the first prompt.
+
In addition to the variables available for a single-host installation, a new option *-n <node_ip>* is used to specify the IP addresses of the scanner nodes. Multiple scanner node IPs are separated by a comma.
+
For example, this command adds 3 scanner nodes:
`sudo ./install.sh -a <account_id> -c <agent_id> -t <token> --host <ds_host> --cm-host <cm_host> *-n <node_ip1>,<node_ip2>,<node_ip3>* --proxy-host <proxy_host> --proxy-port <proxy_port> --proxy-scheme <proxy_scheme> --proxy-user <proxy_user> --proxy-password <proxy_password>`

. Before the manager node installation completes, a dialog displays the installation command needed for the scanner nodes. Copy the command and save it in a text file. For example:
+
`sudo ./node_install.sh -m 10.11.12.13 -t ABCDEF-1-3u69m1-1s35212`

. On *each* scanner node host:
.. Copy the Data Sense installer file (*cc_onprem_installer_<version>.tar.gz*) to the host machine (using `scp` or some other method).
.. Unzip the installer file.
.. Paste and execute the command that you copied in step 3.
+
When the installation finishes on all scanner nodes and they have been joined to the manager node, the manager node installation finishes as well.

.Result

The Cloud Data Sense installer finishes installing packages, docker, and registers the installation. Installation can take 10 to 20 minutes.

.What's Next
From the Configuration page you can select the data sources that you want to scan.

You can also link:task_licensing_datasense.html[set up licensing for Cloud Data Sense] at this time. You will not be charged until the amount of data exceeds 1 TB.
